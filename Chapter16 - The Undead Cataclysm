*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Bloodless pale skin, and possessing black eyes containing, in the center, prominent golden pupils.

With the sudden appearance of the undead army, the campaign for the Imperial City of Lupugana between the Imperial Army and the Rebel Army, the circumstances had literally poured cold water onto both armies.

The battle between the living vying for control of the Empire was changing into a struggle for survival between the living and the dead, and the severity of the battle was becoming increasingly severe.

???: [Uahhhh――!!]

Loudly, he swung his two-handed sword and slammed it into the enemy in front of him.

Their opponents raised their battered sword, which they had picked up from wherever it had come from, and tried to block the blow, but the brittle sword snapped and the blow went straight into the opponent's cranium.

Their cranium shatters, but what follows is not a spectacular scene of blood and brain matter spewing out, but a scene of shards scattered about as if a clay pot were broken, which is certainly not the way a human being would die.

The inhuman things not only look out of place, but even the way they die is not human.

As one who lives in the empire, there are opportunities to see some species that seem to have outlandish features in their appearance, but whether it is an opponent with a different number of arms or eyes, the way they die is the same.
 
It's only reasonable that something with a life should end its life like any other.

But these undead did not. Is that why there is such a strong aversion to them?

Even in an empire where life is said to be cheap compared to other countries, they do not trample on life itself as these undead do.

???: [Support the front! Let His Excellency the Emperor and the civilians escape!]

???: [OOh――!!]

When one of the "generals" gave the order, the soldiers around him shouted as if they were in a fever.

The army of undead and the "Cloud Dragon" went out of control, and the reservoir in the northern part of the Imperial Capital was destroyed, leading to the Emperor's decision to abandon the Imperial Capital and withdraw all troops.

The Imperial Army is united in its efforts to assist in the evacuation of the Emperor and the citizens of the Imperial Capital. Ironically, with the advent of this third force, the battle against the rebels has become irrelevant. The fighting is now fierce, with both sides divided into the living and the dead, with no distinction made between the regular army and the rebels.

Just now, an Imperial soldier who had just destroyed one of the undead was one of those who held their ground. He and the soldiers around him were fighting with all their might to stop as many of the undead as possible, and see if they could take as many of them with them into death.

???: [I have no idea what those things are. But…]

???: [If only it were His Excellency the Emperor!]

???: [He will surely find a way to root them out!]

No matter what the enemy may be, their trust in Vincent Vollachia, the pinnacle of the Empire, would never waver. That is the main reason why the soldiers can remain without fear.

Vincent has continued to deliver results. Imperial soldiers base their trust in Vincent based upon the blood he has made their enemies shed and the number of corpses he has amassed.

Considering the absoluteness of his rule, the purity of his will to fight was different from those who so casually plotted rebellion.

As it was, so was the will to fight against the undead that were threatening to destabilize the Empire.

???: [――Hk! Everybody, take him down!]

Once again, the General cried out in response to the onslaught of the exceptionally large undead.

A bald-headed, huge undead swung his arms around, blasting away at the imperial soldiers who stood in his way like scraps of paper. If they let the giant do what it wants, it will open a hole in the front lines, and the defensive position they have just built may collapse from there.

In order to stop it, the soldiers who obeyed the General's order jumped toward the huge figure at once.

???: [Uu, oohaaaah!!]

The soldier who jumped at him first was struck, scrambling through flying corpses with crushed heads, as an imperial soldier stayed low and slashed at the giant's legs.

The slash hits, and the opponent's stance breaks. However, the Imperial soldier's eyes met the golden eyes looking down at him, and the tip of the sword that had been picked up from someone else flashed dully.

Just before he is skewered by the tip of the sword, a figure intervenes before the eyes of the Imperial soldier.

???: [Yah, reeee…]

The General was pierced through the chest and cried out as blood bubbled out.

The Imperial soldier, shielded by the General, took a breath, immediately jumped out from behind the general's back, swung his sword with all his might, and smashed the giant undead's head in.

The sword broke halfway through the impact, but the giant body did not counterattack. Instead, its entire body shattered.

The General fell to the ground on his back and was met by the giant undead.

The General is dead, his chest pierced, and the Imperial soldier, admiring his bravery, borrows a replacement for his broken sword from the General's hand.

And then, trying to get their heads wrapped around the battlefield in search of the next enemy――,

???: [Fucker…]

The Imperial soldier muttered, his cheeks contorted as he pulled down the helmet he was wearing with his fingers.

The Imperial soldier, who had just escaped death, saw the next undead in his line of sight ――it had the same equipment and face as the General who had just died defending him.

The dead body of the General is lying beside him, and he himself is holding the General's sword.

And yet, there was the same General standing in front of him, with a pale face and golden eyes.

???: [Fucker…]

A battlefield where even your comrades-in-arms turn into the undead and become your enemies as soon as they die.

In a flooded, deadly place that made one want to curse, the Imperial soldier raised his sword and continued to fight for his life.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The coupled dragon carriage retreated from the Imperial Capital of Lupugana and headed towards the Fortified City of Garkla.

The historical alliance formed between the Emilia camp and the Vollachian Empire's leadership within that carriage had unexpectedly encountered interference in an unforeseen manner.

Although, as for the cause of that interference――,

Anastasia: [Well, we were also very concerned about Natsuki-kun. It's sad to be treated with such a face when uninvited guests show up, ain’t it?]

Subaru: [I'm not making such a face! I'm happy that we were able to meet properly. Whether it's Anastasia-san or Julius with his stern expression, I appreciate them both.]

Anastasia: [Well, it ain’t exactly a stern expression, but it's all ‘cause of yer appearance.]

And so, the two people, Julius and Anastasia, who had suddenly boarded the interconnected dragon carriage, looked down at the shrunken Subaru from top to bottom with keen interest.

Naturally, for Subaru, encountering the two of them there was like a bolt from the blue.

The level of surprise was comparable to when Priscilla had suddenly descended from the sky in the Fortress City.

Moreover, why those two had ended up in the Vollachian Empire, Subaru was not so naive as to be unable to guess the reason.

Subaru: [Even so, I understand that Emilia-tan and the others were looking for us, but for Anastasia-san and them… to come all the way through the Kararagi route just for me?]

Anastasia: [Yes, exactly. It was a grand adventure, crossing through three countries. Crossing the border to Vollachia ain’t something that can be done easily, and the journey was quite costly, to say the least.]

Subaru: [Urk.]

Anastasia: [I hate to bring up something stingy, but I'd be happy if ya could not forget about the price of the bone we broke.]

Being sent to the Empire was beyond Subaru's control, but when he heard about the concerns that were expressed for him, his heart felt heavy. Under Anastasia's gaze and words, it seemed like Subaru was about to be burdened with a tremendous debt of gratitude.

However, at that moment, a voice calling her "Ana" could be heard near Anastasia's neck,

Echidna: [You shouldn't bully Natsuki-kun recklessly. Considering his current appearance, no matter how you look at it, Ana, you seem like the villain bullying a child.]

Anastasia: [Ah…]

When Subaru raised his eyebrows at that voice, the other party responded by wagging a white tail.

It was the fox scarf that Anastasia, who was dressed in a kimono, had draped over her shoulders. In other words, it was Echidna, the Artificial Spirit, whom Anastasia was carrying with her.

Unlike the Witch with the same name, Subaru had a recognition of Echidna as a companion who he had gone through the ordeal of the Pleiades Watchtower together with. Hearing her voice, Subaru also felt relieved and at ease.

With this, among the companions who had gotten separated in the Pleiades Watchtower, once Subaru showed his face to Patrasche, who was outside, he had yet to show that he was safe to Meili only.

Anyway――,

Emilia: [Anastasia-san! Julius, too, you made it to Vollachia safely!]

Anastasia: [I'm relieved that Emilia-san ‘n the others are safe too. As for the hardships during the journey… I couldn't find Natsuki-kun before Emilia-san ‘n the others did, so it's a bit embarrassing.]

Emilia: [No, that thought makes me feel reaaally happy. Thank you.]


Emilia also welcomed Anastasia's appearance with a relaxed smile on her face.

Indeed, with the situation in the Vollachian Empire already tense, and on top of that, there was the undead disaster following the civil war. Inadvertently, she could say that she was very grateful that she did not cross paths with Anastasia and the others in the Imperial Capital.

And with the joy of such an unexpected reunion coming to a pause――,

Vincent: [Have you finished warming up your old friendship sufficiently? Whether you know it or not, the time for the military conference is limited.]

And it was Abel, with a cheeky attitude and arms crossed, who dampened the mood with those words.

With an unusually tolerant demeanor, he had been trying to gauge the atmosphere, but it seemed like he had reached his limit of staying silent. Making a sarcastic remark, Abel glanced sideways at Subaru and then said,

Vincent: [Another of your acquaintances. I never expected you to stretch your neck as far as Kararagi.]

Subaru: [As for that, it's a bit complicated. Anastasia-san and the others are on the Kararagi side, but not exactly on the Kararagi side… So, what's the deal with that?]

Subaru's puzzled question stemmed from the presence of Halibel, who stood beside Anastasia and the others. Halibel, the wolfperson who was known as the strongest in the Kararagi City-States, demonstrated his existence while shaking the smoking pipe he held. Subaru wondered what position Anastasia and her group held, given Halibel's title and affiliation.

Julius: [I will take that explanation. Directly, I will tell you how he even managed to get me on the flying dragon ship.]

In response to Subaru's question, Julius brushed the scar beneath his left eye with his finger and began to answer.

The new white scar on Julius' profile, combined with his unfamiliar appearance in a Waso outfit, emphasized his dignified and handsome aura, giving Subaru a strange sensation.

It was not to say that the influence of "regression" had not affected Subaru's perception, but it was probably more due to the changes on Julius' side that caused this sensation.

Somehow, it felt like the current Julius had more composure than before.

While there was elegance in his previous demeanor as the "Finest of Knights", it seemed to be different from his current composure. It might have even been considered something that stood in stark contrast to it.

His attitude, which seemed like he had discarded long-worn armor, was it a result of the experience in the Pleiades Watchtower, or was there some other reason behind it? That remained uncertain.

Julius: [――Your Excellency the Emperor, Emperor Vincent Vollachia, I am relieved to see you safe and well. It is an unexpected honor to have the privilege of an audience with you once again.]


Ignoring Subaru's impression, Julius, having taken a step forward, bowed as he elegantly spoke.

Abel, protected by Goz’s large build as he stood, raised his shapely eyebrows at Julius's greeting. Subaru, too, harbored a sense of unease with Julius’s "once again" part.

Vincent: [“Once again” you say, hm. But, neither do I remember granting audience to a swordsman of the City-States, nor do I recognize your face. What prompted you to say  "once again"?]

Julius: [With all due respect, I once received the opportunity to have a glimpse. However, at the time I was not a swordsman of the City-States, but a knight of the Kingdom.]

Vincent: [The Kingdom――]

Upon hearing the response of Julius, who did not show fear even when addressing Abel, the Vollachian Emperor, Abel’s black eyes narrowed in deep thought, but he could not seem to find any memory of the occasion.

With such a dignified demeanor, there was no way that Julius could possibly be telling a lie. As such, even though the two were actually acquainted with each other, Abel had forgotten it.

In other words, it was evidence that the effects of Gluttony, which caused those around Julius to forget him, had yet to be undone――.

Vincent: [You are deceiving me, and thus I do not understand your behavior. ――Berstetz.]

Berstetz: [Yes. I, too, have no recollection of ever seeing this person.]

Vincent: [It would be rare for Berstetz to not be present at an audience. That is to say, it is not an issue between you and I, but one of a larger scale.]

By merely questioning the presence of Julius within Berstetz’s memories with a single word, Abel detected that extraordinary circumstances were entangled in the discrepancy of perceptions between himself and Julius.

Witnessing Abel’s speech and conduct, Subaru could not help but mutter “Is this guy for real?”

Subaru: [Is it really normal to accept that so easily? Something that’s so absurd…]

Vincent: [We are in the midst of an emergency, in which the dead have risen, and the Emperor is being driven away from the Imperial Capital. Speaking of the grand scheme of things, the fact that your body has shrunk does not make much of a difference either. What matters is whether or not it can be conceived as possible.]

Subaru: [I wouldn't say that me shrinking is something that happens every day either though.]

No matter what kind of profound mysteries this world held, even if those were deemed as plausible theories just because they could be conceived, did not make them things that could be so easily accepted with an “Ah yes, I see”.

As Subaru's brow wrinkled, Beatrice, holding his hand, rubbed the wrinkle between Subaru's brow with her other hand.

Beatrice: [Don't overthink it too much, I suppose. It's much more convenient if they have the tolerance to accept it, than if they were to be obstinate about it, in fact.]

Subaru: […That's true. Also, that feels good, please keep doing it a little longer.]

Beatrice: [Roger that, I suppose.]

While Subaru continued to receive an eyebrow massage from Beatrice, Julius, with the questions that arose from the first act of his greeting canceled, he returned to the main topic.

That was――,

Julius: [First of all, the lady present here is Anastasia Hoshin-sama… I presume you have already been made aware of Emilia-sama's identity and status, but Anastasia-sama is also of the same status.]

Serena: [Hoho, the same as Miss Emilia. In other words, candidates for the next king of the Kingdom are together in a foreign country. My goodness, that's quite the amusing and rare situation.]

Serena contorted her facial scar in amusement, and Julius nodded silently at her words. At his affirmation, the gazes of the Imperial camp members turned towards Emilia, and meeting those gazes, her lips formed a smile.

Emilia: [Yes, Julius is telling the truth. Anastasia-san and I are both candidates for the Royal Selection, and we’re friends.]

Anastasia: [Tho’ for the time bein’, the thing ‘bout bein’ friends is an agreement for after the Royal Selection is over. ――Followin’ that introduction, I’m a representative of the Kararagi’s Hoshin Trading Company ‘n one of the candidates for the Royal Selection in the Kingdom of Lugunica.]

Vincent: [In addition to that impressive title, you are yet another person of the Kingdom?]

Anastasia: [I feel a lil’ sorry if my title happened to surprise ya, but to tell ya the truth it ain’t the only title I got right now. That's the reason we went out of our way to ride that flying dragon ship, ain’t it?]

Just a short while ago, Abel had formed a friendly alliance with Emilia as the head of the Empire. As Abel expressed his disapproval at the fact that another person from the Kingdom had now become involved here, Anastasia put a stop to that.

As Anastasia noted that she had a title that had yet to be disclosed, Emilia put her finger to her lips with a puzzled look on her face.

Emilia: [But, Anastasia-san is a representative of the Trading Company, a candidate for Royal Selection… and there’s still more? Oh, maybe the employer of the mercenary group that Mimi and the others are a part of?]

Anastasia: [The Iron Fang’s under the jurisdiction of the Hoshin Trading Company, so I don't bother to add it to the title of Trading Company representative. Still, it’s a separate matter from that.]

Emilia: [Separate…]

Told that she was incorrect by Anastasia, Emilia muttered in an adorable, troubled voice.

And beside Anastasia as she smiled at Emilia's behavior, Julius gestured to her with his hand,

Julius: [On this occasion, Anastasia-sama is acting on behalf of Kararagi’s League of Cities―― Appointed as an emissary, she has betaken herself to the Empire.]

Otto: [――The Kararagi League of Cities!?]

Hearing Julius’s reply, it was Otto whose voice had capsized.

Otto broke his silence with an uncomfortable expression, to which Subaru thought was the right opportunity to ask "What's the League of Cities?".

Subaru: [I've heard that Kararagi is called a city-state, a country with many cities joined together.]

Otto: [――. That understanding is correct.The Kararagi City-States are, roughly speaking, a country composed of ten large cities. Each city has its own mayor, who is the representative of the city, and there is a council formed by these people, which is the League of Cities.]

Subaru: [Huh… It's like the Council of Ten in Pristella.]

Otto: [Rather, Pristella's Council of Ten is probably inspired by the League of Cities. As is the case with the Water Plumage Pavilion, there is a large influx of Kararagi culture in Pristella along the border.]

Subaru: [Oh, come to think of it…]

The Water Plumage Pavilion, where they had stayed at the invitation of Anastasia and her companions, was said to have wafu-style both inside and out, which had been introduced from Kararagi.

Going further back, Subaru believed that Kararagi's wafu-style itself might be knowledge that was brought from his world, but he put that aside for the time being.

In any case――,

Subaru: [It's not a peaceful situation when you're not only a candidate for the Kingdom's Royal Selection, but you've also entered the Empire at the behest of the League of Cities as an emissary.]

Anastasia: [You're right, although not as bad as Lugunica, Vollachia isn't on the best of terms with Kararagi. I mean, the Empire is basically hostile to everyone.]

Subaru: [It's probably because the Emperor is so sharp. Maybe his corners will be a little rounder in the future.]

Vincent: [Silence.]

When Subaru took advantage of Anastasia's brazen and blunt comments, Abel, without changing his expression, hurled an admonishment at Subaru.

Subaru stuck his tongue out at that, and Julius was taken aback by this exchange with Abel.

Naturally, he looked at Subaru in surprise, but since it would have been a long story if he were to explain, Subaru glossed over the situation by simply sticking his tongue out at Julius as well.

Anastasia: [We heard about the mess in Vollachia while we were in Kararagi, but didn't take advantage of it at the time.]

Vincent: [That is very auspicious. However, it is not as if you have no intention of doing so.]

Anastasia: [Well, you've gotta be tough to get by. Wouldn't it be more uncomfortable for ya to be helped for free?]

Vincent: [――. But of course.]

At that mischievous look in Anastasia's eyes, Abel's gaze briefly turned toward Emilia.

Emilia looked at them curiously, but from Abel and Anastasia's points of view, Emilia's good intentions were probably more miscalculated.

As one would expect, Subaru would not go so far as to say that they should help Abel and the others without compensation, and if they did, Otto would give them a thousand sermons from hell.

Then, a hoarse voice asked for a chance to speak.

When Berstetz received Abel's silent affirmation, he turned his narrow, nearly thread-like eyes toward Anastasia and Julius, while saying,

Berstetz: [I am wondering, may I ask why the City-States have sent an emissary to the Empire in its current state? Perhaps, you suspect that the problems of the Empire have come to your country, and you are pursuing them?]

Anastasia: [Even Kararagi, which believes that "time and money are of equal value", certainly wouldn't come to talk about money in the middle of such a busy day. Interference in internal affairs will only cause loss if you're not prepared for it.]

Halibel: [That's a roundabout way of puttin' it. Besides, as said, time's limited.]

Anastasia: [You're impatient, aren'tcha? All right, all right, all right. ――Halibel.]

Halibel: [Hm? Can I say somethin'?]

Anastasia called Halibel to her side as the Imperial leaders were eager to proceed.

Leaning against the wall of the dragon carriage, Halibel, who was making a ring with the smoke from his kiseru, stroked the fur on his chin as the gazes gathered from around him.

In Subaru's eyes, his fur was really nice, lush, and full coat.

Halibel: [So I'm gonna tell ya somethin'… Actually, somethin' strange has been goin' on in Kararagi for a while now. I've been urged by the League of Cities to figure it out.]

Subaru: [Something strange?]

Halibel: [Ya might have an idea. ――Hotoke-san is on the move.]

Emilia: [Hotoke?]

Subaru gasped at Halibel's easy-going, slightly pretentious words. But, Emilia and Goz tilted their heads at the unfamiliar word.

Halibel chuckled at the reaction saying, "My bad, my bad"

Halibel: [Yeah, yeah, my Kararagi dialect can be hard ta follow. Hotoke-san means corpse in Kararagi. In other words…]

Subaru: [――Did the City-States also get damaged by the undead?]

Halibel: [Somethin’ like that]

Halibel calmly nodded, and once again, the same shock spread to Emilia and the others as it did to Subaru.

Given the army of undead who had attacked the Imperial Capital, if the same thing happened in Kararagi, it would mean the disaster was not confined to the Empire.

Subaru: [T-then, you’re saying this is happening on a global scale if we’re unlucky, right? What happened to that zombie disturbance in Kararagi?]

Halibel: [Zombie?]

Subaru: [The moving dead! It’s easier to understand if they have a name.]

Halibel: [Aah, I see, I see. Well, I dunno the word, but it’s easy to say.]

Halibel, who was in a somewhat good mood, replied to Subaru's answer by moving his smoking pipe up and down in his mouth. But still, Subaru, frustrated by Halibel's response, leaned forward saying, "Halibel-san!”

Every moment, if the undead cataclysm continued to grow――.

Subaru: [There’s not a moment to lose. Since you came to the Empire…]

Halibel: [Don't worry, I took care of the zombie disturbance in Kararagi. So don’t’cha fuss ‘bout the commotion in Kararagi.]

Subaru: [Ah…]

Halibel: [Yer such a sweet kid, wanna toffee…? Ah, I don’t have any toffee on me.]

Without even a gesture of searching his sleeves, Halibel hushed Subaru with a lighthearted tone. Involuntarily, Subaru pouted his lips, as he felt rebuked for his hurried attitude.

Anastasia: [Accordin’ to Halibel's investigation here, the undead in question… No, if ya follow the flow of zombie damage since their outbreak, it seems that the damage has gradually been headin’ towards the Empire. Thus, the League of Cities has been formed to investigate the incidents that have occurred in the country ‘n to alert yer country to the situation――]

Anastasia: [We hired Halibel, who is fully informed on the events, and I’ve taken on the role as an emissary for the League of Cities. That's why we crossed the border to help.]

That was how Anastasia promptly summed up, how she took on the role of emissary for the League of Cities.

They may have been concerned that it did not sound too resolute, but unfortunately, no matter how much they tried, the content of the story was unavoidably rough.

In particular, the fact that the undead cataclysm had occurred earlier in Kararagi――,

Vincent: [Things were happening in the City-States before the Empire. If that is the case, can it be claimed that the recent undead calamity was brought to the Empire from your territory?]

Anastasia: [That's one possibility, but we have another theory.]

Vincent: [Ho. If you are not trying to avoid responsibility, let me hear it.]

Anastasia: [Kararagi was the first Hotoke-san… where the zombies first caused damage. ――But, I think the main goal was Vollachia, ‘n Kararagi was a trainin’ ground before that.]

Anastasia replied to Abel's snide remarks with the same attitude.

Despite her easy going demeanor, the hypothesis she posited was a rather gruesome one. The view of Kararagi as a training ground, and Vollachia as the main event was too distasteful.

Emilia: [Why does Anastasia-san think so? That the attack on Kararagi was not serious, and that Vollachia is the main goal.]

Anastasia: [The scale of damage.]

Anastasia replied to Emilia's query, which was exactly what Subaru had in mind. She delved into Emilia's amethyst eyes with her own light green eyes,

Anastasia: [The account was convoluted, but the first reports of damage to the Imperial Capital were received at Garkla. Even if it's not completely accurate, it's still true that the Imperial Capital was taken by zombies, ain’t it?]

Julius: [It is not unusual to see the Vollachian Empire's capital, Lupugana, taken and the citizens of the capital evacuated en masse. Therefore, I am sure that the "enemy" who caused this situation had the Empire in mind.]

Vincent: [That makes sense.]

Abel briefly responded to the inferences made by Anastasia and Julius.

But the Emperor, deep in thought behind his quiet black eyes, prefaced his speech with the word "incidentally" and turned his gaze toward Halibel.

Vincent: [The damage you spoke of being quelled in the City-States, what truly happened? Regardless of the state of affairs in the Empire, I have not heard of any city-states being destroyed by the undead.]

Halibel: [That’s right. I stopped it before it happened… but I think their goal wasn’t ta mess up Kararagi, but ta get used ta it, just like lil’ Ana said.]

Vincent: [What does that mean?]

Halibel: [Simply put, the zombies I confronted had entirely replaced the people in the city ‘n were livin’ their lives as if they were still alive. They didn’t want us ta know that they had been switched.]

Subaru: [Wha…]

Subaru was taken aback by Halibel's revelation.

Subaru was not the only one surprised. The wise people all had thoughtful expressions on their faces, and everyone that was as surprised as Subaru was speechless.

It would be so. Just now, Halibel's story was far too different from what had been expected.

Goz: [You, you are saying that the undead are going as far as pretending to be the living!? It is true that Her Excellency Lamia used to speak the same way as she did then when she was alive…! Even so!]

Serena: [If you see them as the living, then that destroys the perception of them being an opponent who attacks indiscriminately. It's troublesome just to have them with wisdom, but if that happens, our treatment of them as an enemy will change too much. This has become much too interesting.]

Goz: [What is interesting about this, High Countess Dracroy! There is a limit to your impudence!!]

Goz and Serena’s views were pitted against each other as a shocking embodiment of that misconception.

However, that reaction from the two was natural. In fact, Subaru had the same opinion. It was not just about fighting them, it was a matter of exploiting their weakness.

Even still――,

Emilia: [Hey, Halibel-san, you said that everyone in the town was turned into “<u>zombies</u>”… How many people lived in that town?]

It was a question that someone had to ask.

Subaru regretted letting Emilia do it instead of himself. That regret grew deeper and bigger after hearing Halibel's answer.

That was because――,

Halibel: [――Roughly, about 2,000 people.]

Emilia: [No way…]

Halibel's answer clearly quantified the scale of the damage.

One could only imagine that drastic scale of damage; that made Emilia's expression severely darken, and drove a cold, sharp thorn into Subaru's chest.

But Halibel's answer did not just hurt, some of them looked ahead.

Anastasia: [I have to say it's troublesome if this many pretend to be the livin’. What triggered it to be exposed?]

Halibel: [The reason I found out was the amount of supplies that were goin’ in n’ out of the city. I've disguised myself to some extent, but the number of livin’ and dead people doesn't match. Hotoke-san doesn't need food or drinkin’ water, that's where it went wrong.]

Vincent: [Boundary between the living and the dead. ――Can that be crossed?]

Unlike Subaru, whose emotions halted him, Abel and Anastasia did not stop.

While he felt frustrated by that difference, he also did not want to forget what he had told Abel, that it was necessary to not throw away this frustration.

Vincent: [Berstetz, you had an army stationed in the western part of the Empire, right?]

While Subaru ground his teeth, Abel asked Berstetz a question.

Berstetz nodded briefly with a “Yes” to the Emperor's question,

Berstetz: [We have received reports of unrest along the border with Kararagi in the western part of the country. It was before the signs of civil war were spreading, but we were afraid of becoming polarized with the rebel army, so we kept it in check. ――You do not mean.]

Vincent: [It must have been Groovy Gumlet entrusted with the army.]

His narrowly threaded eyes opened slightly, and Berstetz laid bare his astonishment. As if agreeing with the Prime Minister's realization, Abel let out a small sigh.

That sigh spoke of one of the Nine Divine Generals―― he was supposed to be the one general whom Subaru had never had a chance to meet face to face.

The reason why Abel narrowed his eyes languidly when he said that person's name was――,

Goz: [Your Excellency! Oh no… Surely not! General Groovy!]

Vincent: [Disturbances on the borders of the City-States… If that is why they did not participate in the Great War in the Imperial Capital, and if we can not meet with them, then there is no other recourse but to assume the worst.]

Serena: [Worst assumption, huh? Even I would have a hard time calling that amusing.]

Goz’s face flushed red, and Serena erased the thin smile on her lips.

Nodding at these leading figure’s reactions, Abel went on to say.

Vincent: [――Groovy Gumlet and his army have already fallen into the hands of the Undead. If they fail to join us in the future, we should make that assumption.]

Goz: [――Hk!]

In response to Abel's words, Goz shook his whole body and gnashed his molars.

It was not a metaphor, he really ground his molars. So much resentment ran through the body of the warrior named Goz Ralfon, and the possibility of losing his comrades was hitting him hard.

Even for Subaru and the others, who did not know the real thing, it was a silent blow.

Berstetz: [Your Excellency, as per your speculation, if an undead can feign as the living, then…]

Vincent: [Indeed, the reports from various regions, on their own, have lost credibility. Without increasing the accuracy of the information, to engage in the battle for the recapture of the Imperial Capital will be next to impossible.]

The delivered reports, about whether they were from their living allies or from the undead enemy, was not known.

Conferred with such a frightening possibility, Subaru gasped.

Subaru: [In other words, that’s the reason why the League of Cities entrusted Anastasia-san with being their emissary…]

Anastasia: [The sense of crisis, y’all feel it too, don’t’cha? It absolutely mustn't be allowed ta spread. For now, let's jus’ let a small group of reliable people go ahead.]

Anastasia spoke while nodding, to which both Julius and Halibel also expressed agreement.

They were the two people chosen as reliable individual forces to start the offensive against the undead.

Subaru: [What about Ricardo, Mimi and the others?]

Anastasia: [They're buildin’ a united front with the League of Cities at the border. Basically, they won't be enterin’ the Empire. If it doesn’t stop with the Empire, Kararagi will have to be prepared.]

Halibel: [That’s a bad omen, gimme a break. Well, at this point, it's no surprise that lil’ Ana has a foul mouth.]

Anastasia: [Halibel.]

Anastasia, who had answered the whereabouts of the absent Iron Fang, looked at Halibel with a smile. She put her hand on her cheek in a soft gesture, and kept her gaze fixed on Halibel,

Anastasia: [I neglected it the first time, but can ya stop callin’ me lil’ Ana? I'm no longer a child, and I’m also the representative of Kararagi.]

Halibel: [Even if ya say yer not a child, ya don't look any different from when ya were a child. Yer character hasn't changed from the old days when Ricardo and ya were so mischievous…]

Anastasia: [Halibel.]

Halibel: [Alright, alright, my bad.]

Waving his hand, Halibel raised the white flag before Anastasia.

The seemingly familiar relationship between the two was troubling, but compared to the pressing issue at hand, it could only be considered a trivial matter.

Indeed, from the point of view of having to defend against the unprecedented undead cataclysm――.

Anastasia: [Once again, I would like to convey the intentions of Kararagi’s League of Cities. In order to cease the damage caused by the living corpses… the damage caused by the zombies, the City-States will extend as much support as possible to the Empire.]

Vincent: [――. The details of a response regarding the support need to be worked out. Are you people aware of any means to stop this situation?]

Halibel: [‘Bout that, it can't be a natural phenomenon that Hotoke-san wakes up, can it? It's clearly the result of someone's gaudy intentions. In other words――]

Anastasia: [――The mastermind, the caster, the ringleader, or whatever you want to call it, vanquish them.]

A colossal obstacle that could plunge the entire world into crisis, and how to overcome it.

Stopping the unseen “enemy”, the entity responsible for this problem, was the highest priority of the Kingdom of Lugunica, the Vollachian Empire, and Kararagi’s League of Cities――.

Subaru: [――The unidentified “enemy”.]

Thinking of the "enemy" whose true nature was unknown, Subaru murmured softly.

What did this “enemy” look like, and just what were they thinking when they made preparations to commit such terrible barbaric acts?

The mere thought of the hardships and obstacles that awaited them in their quest to defeat this yet-to-be-seen "enemy" sent cold sweat down his spine.

However――,

Subaru: [――With this many members gathered here.]

Subaru's heart, which was being filled with fear, was nevertheless encouraged by the presence of those around him.

The Emilia camp who had even come to the Empire in search of Subaru and the others, the leaders of the Empire who hardened their resolve to work as one for the sake of protecting it, and the reliable reinforcements form Kararagi.

Subaru: [No matter what the “enemy” is planning, we absolutely cannot lose――!]

That was Natsuki Subaru’s sincere declaration of war against the “enemy”.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Indeed, it was around the same time as Subaru’s surge of enthusiasm from within the coupled dragon carriages.

Ferociously, the reservoir’s water gushed forth from the destroyed bulwark, engulfing the Imperial Capital.

As the muddy torrent swept away buildings and tore people and trees asunder indiscriminately, the blue-haired boy, having escaped to a high vantage point, used his hand as a visor as he gazed over the view. 

Boy: [Oh dear I tried to buy as much time as I could but I wonder if everyone was able to successfully escape. Hopefully Boss and the others didn't let the blood rush to their heads and mess up the decision to retreat.]

Lightheartedly muttering so, clad in a kimono and wearing zori was Cecilus.

In this grand battle for the Imperial Capital, as the most difficult problem in all aspects concerning the complete change in the situation was identified by his natural intuition and drama-geek mindset, the leading actor of the world rushed to the scene.

In fact, if Cecilus had not taken such a selfish and arbitrary action, the Imperial Capital would have been engulfed by water much sooner, and many more people would have failed to escape, resulting in an enormous amount of casualties.

In that sense, Cecilus's actions, beyond anyone’s expectations, coincidentally brought about a fortunate outcome for many.

However, that was not the case for Cecilus, as the person concerned. 

With the sudden appearance of the undead forces, the state of the battle for the Imperial Capital had changed, and trying to surprise the third "enemy" who was attempting to snatch victory through a boorish intervention, Cecilus had leapt forth.

Undoubtedly, he was in a state where he could sing his own praises of it having been a performance meant to enchant the world.

And yet――, 

Cecilus: [Even so, this was completely unexpected.]

Within the Imperial Capital engulfed by the muddy torrent, Cecilus murmured so, scratching his cheeks at the sight of undead who had all fled to higher ground like he had, still maintaining their fixation over those who yet live.

There was no doubt that they existed outside the natural order, resurrected by a technique unknown even to Cecilus. 

In fact, he had also encountered the being that had made them into such things.

Even though everything up to that point had proceeded in accordance with Cecilus's intuition――,

Cecilus: [――Unbelievable, who could’ve imagined that the situation wouldn’t be settled even when the caster is defeated!]

Collapsed at the feet of Cecilus as he raised his voice, was the caster who had resurrected and commanded the undead.

With beautiful pink hair and long ears, the young girl appeared to be around the same age as Cecilus―― Having confronted the “Blue Lighting”, Cecilus, she was a “Witch” whose life had already come to an end.
