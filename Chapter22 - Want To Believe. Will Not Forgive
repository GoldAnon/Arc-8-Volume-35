*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*a

???: [――Village Chief-kun, may I have a moment?]

As a voice called out to him from behind, Vincent Vollachia halted his step.

Before he even turned around, he knew who the owner of that voice was. Once he heard a voice, or laid eyes on a person, he would never forget it. This was no exception; he immediately grasped that this was the blond, blue-eyed peddler―― Flop O’Connell.

Vincent: [Unfortunately, the survival of the Empire is currently in crisis. I have not the time for frivolous chatter with you.]

Though he had grasped it, Vincent would not engage any further than grasping it.

The oracle he had received a moment ago from the Stargazer, Ubilk, left him no choice but to discuss with Berstetz, Serena, and the rest of that lot regarding how they would handle it.

Groovy had been designated as a countermeasure against the enemy, but since there was a high chance he had lost his life, to formulate a plan that depended on him would be an act akin to the height of stupidity. On that point, putting his expectations in Natsuki Subaru, who was headed to persuade the other person who had been designated, was a foolish idea that was less objectionable. 

In the first place, there was no chance that Vincent would be able to persuade that girl.

He would not even be able to come to a mutual understanding with her. Since the cards in Vincent’s hand could not be used on the young girl, it was logical to let Subaru deal with that side of the two lights.

Ergo, the only thing Vincent could do was continue scrutinizing the details for a realistic plan――,

Flop: [Woah there, you can’t know whether it’s frivolous chatter or not unless you talk and find out! No matter how clever Village Chief-kun is, I doubt you’d be able to tell what seeds of conversation I have before you water them!]

Vincent: [You…]

Speaking those words, Flop grabbed Vincent’s shoulder as the latter tried to resume his walk, preventing him from moving forward. Naught could that be called but a reckless action, the very pinnacle of imprudence.

Under different circumstances, it would have been a barbaric act that caused Flop to be beheaded on the spot.

Vincent: [Release me at once. If not, wish your life goodbye.]

Flop: [Of course, I’d also like to start talking with you right away. But, I want a suitable amount of time to have a proper discussion about this matter. We can’t be rushing things.]

Vincent: [I did not tell you to speak, but to release your grip…]

???: [Now, now, don’t say that, Abel-chin. Instead, you should talk about what big bro wants to tell you.]

Vincent: [――Hk!?]

As he looked back with his head and scowled at Flop, who still had his hand placed on Vincent’s shoulder, a voice had called out from in front of him; simultaneously, another reckless act had been performed, that of two hands grabbing him by his sides and lifting him up.

Having held her breath, and now giving a cheerful broad smile, the one who had done that was Medium O’Connell―― The sibling duo of Flop and Medium, had pincered Vincent with smiles from both front and rear.

Medium: [Abel-chin, you’ve been disregarding big bro this whole time, right? Big bro is so injured and worn-out that he always needs to lie down for even just a second longer, so don’t be mean and just listen to what he has to say~]

Vincent: [Speak not of foolish things. To begin with, how long shall you continue to contact me with such a familiar attitude? Should the situation change, so shall individual positions. Things are no longer the same as they were in the Shudraqian Village and the Fortress City.]

Medium: [Well, Abel-chin may be acting like the Emperor, but I think it’s mistaken of you to make light of us! Big bro!]

Flop: [Got it, dear sister!]

The unreasonable sibling pair, did not lend their ears to Vincent’s words.

At the high-spirited call of his younger sister, Flop, responding in a similarly energetic manner, promptly opened the door to the adjacent guest cabin; Medium then carried Vincent inside, and the door was closed.

After quickly confining the Emperor in a locked room, Medium finally released Vincent.

Vincent: [You two, are you aware that this is an act so barbaric that not only you, but all members of your household will be punished for?]

Flop: [Hahahaha, unfortunately for you, Village Chief-kun, our family purely consists of us two siblings. So, your objection isn’t really much of a threat.]

Medium: [Ah, but, big bro, what about everyone from the orphanage? Even if we aren’t related by blood, everyone who escaped is our family!]

Flop: [Hahahaha, now that you mention it! Village Chief-kun, please find it within yourself to forgive us!]

Vincent: [――Set me free immediately, and behave.]

No matter the situation, the conduct of the O’Connell siblings seemed invariant. 

Medium had been shrunken and stretched, and Flop seemed to have been injured, but seeing the both of them like this was causing him to grow suspicious. 

If one had their body shrunken and stretched, it would typically be a heavy burden on their mind, but Medium was far too lacking in awareness that her body had shrunk and then grown back again.

He had heard that Flop had also suffered a grievous wound that brought him to the verge of death, but he too was full of life. ――No, his neck had a visible complexion, but it seemed he was concealing the color in his face using make-up. 

Flop: [After all, it’s quite important for merchants to put on an act.]

Vincent: [――――]

Flop: [But, although it’s always been an ironclad rule of trade to barter for what you want, I’m unable to meet Village Chief-kun’s current demands. I don’t wanna put this off any longer.]

Vincent: [What are you saying…]

Flop: [I’ve been entrusted with a message. ――A message from the person who, in your place, had acted as Emperor.]

Having expected him to start speaking more nonsense, Vincent’s eyes slightly widened.

Going out of their way to confine the Emperor in an empty cabin, the O’Connell siblings were attempting to report something to Vincent. ――In this world, there was only one person who had held that position.

That was why――,

Flop: [You ought to hear his words, Village Chief-kun. ――No, Your Excellency the Emperor, Vincent Vollachia.]

Thus, as Flop displayed a serious expression for the first time, Vincent chose not to interrupt him with words.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb.

When he spoke those words aloud, Subaru had heard a grating sound reverberate within his heart. While it was always within arms reach, he had always hesitated to take the lid off of that box of taboos. It was a Pandora’s box that could be opened at any time, so long as he was willing to do so.

???: [――――]

Deciding this was not a conversation suitable for a corridor, they had relocated, moving to a spacious guest cabin.

Abel's thoughtful allowance for them to use this cabin if necessary was a rare display of consideration for the feelings of others. ―― a consideration, perhaps owing to the possibility that the resolution of this matter could be of critical importance to the Empire itself.

Gathered in the guest room were Emilia and Beatrice, Otto and Garfiel, and Roswaal of Emilia's camp, and in addition――

Anastasia: [The Sin Archbishop of Gluttony… Really, we seem to have quite an unfortunate connection with it.]

Anastasia, delicately touching her cheek, quietly murmured, with Julius maintaining a solemn silence by her side. The participation of these two was also essential.

That was not merely because they had come from far across the border to assist Subaru and his company, but because they were victims of Gluttony as well.

Subaru: [As for the crucial person, Louis, she's currently with Rem and the others. Everyone except Anastasia-san and Julius should already know about Louis…]

Beatrice: [Of course, in fact. …Frankly, it was an outrageous surprise at first, I suppose.]

Subaru: [That… was the case for me too.]

Beatrice's expression of surprise was likely a generous understatement.

In fact, when Subaru had first realized that he had been transported with Louis, his sole intention was to protect Rem, which caused him to adopt a rather aggressive stance. At first, this led to Rem being quite wary of him, perceiving him as someone who could not be trusted.

Subaru did not know under what circumstances Emilia and the others had met Louis, but it was not difficult to imagine that their initial contact would have been fraught with tension.

With that in mind, he wanted to express his gratitude that no one had resorted to extreme measures.

Subaru: [You all held yourselves back admirably. I'm sure Otto and Garfiel were ready to explode at any moment.]

Otto: [Indeed, Garfiel and I were of the opinion that we should either expel her or restrain her. The fact that she was not subjected to either was due to Emilia-sama persuading everyone around her.]

Subaru: [Emilia-tan…]

As one might expect, it seemed that Otto was at the forefront of the radical faction, but his views had apparently been tempered by the more moderate Emilia.

Upon receiving Subaru and the others' glances, she gave a short nod, saying, "Yes,"

Emilia: [Medium-chan was desperately defending that child… Louis. Considering how much those around her cherished her, I thought it would be horrible to make any decisions about her on the spot.]

Subaru: [I see, Medium-san…]

Hearing that Medium had defended Louis, Subaru felt a faint sense of relief.

Originally, Louis had grown quite attached to the cheerful and caring Medium. Still, the last interaction Subaru had witnessed between the two, back in the Demon City of Chaosflame, was marked by Medium's fear of Louis after her identity as a Sin Archbishop had been revealed.

If Medium had still defended Louis after that, there must have been some shift in her feelings that had taken place. This was a comforting thought.

Emilia: [That's something I've experienced, too. Having people say that I'm reaaally scary, that I'm a Witch, and the people around me don't want to talk to me. So…]

Otto: [In Emilia-sama's case, however, it was due to irrational prejudice against half-elves. But with this girl, there is a difference. It is a clear distinction, resulting from her own actions.]

Emilia: [Otto-kun…]

In addition to defending Medium, as Emilia explained why she stood by Louis, Otto bluntly offered his stern comment. He did not hesitate to clarify his position as an ally of Emilia and, simultaneously, an adversary of Louis.

Indeed, their journey together so far was nothing more than a stay of execution until the final conclusion.

Roswaal: [May I have a word?]

Into the tense atmosphere created by Otto's declaration, Roswaal raised his hand casually. 
As Subaru’s glance urged him to speak, Roswaal closed his blue eye and,

Roswaal: [Since I, Ram, and Anastasia-sama joined later, we really don't know how that girl, Louis, behaaaves~… but, is there cause for suspicion? Of course, Garfiel had his eyes, ears, and nose shining, didn't he?]

Garfiel: [I wasn't exactly shinin' from head to toe like that. But, I gotta agree with Ottobro. That's why, from the moment we met her till the big battle, I kept a close eye on her…]

Roswaal: [So, it turned out to be a wild goose chase. Theeen~, how can you definitively say that the girl is a dangerous Sin Archbishop?]

Otto: [Because of Beatrice-chan and I. We encountered a girl claiming to be Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, in Pristella. I had my leg gouged out then, and it is not something I will ever forget.]

Roswaal, representing those who had less interaction with Louis, made a statement to which Garfiel and Otto expressed their respective views.

As Otto stroked his leg, it was a reminder of the injury that had caused him to be taken out of action for quite some time. 

It made sense as to why Otto, in particular, was very cautious of Louis.

Julius: [My apologies for following the Margrave, but may I also speak?]

Once Roswaal's question had been addressed, Julius quickly joined the conversation.

In this discussion about Gluttony, Julius, who had been making a difficult face from the beginning, glanced at an even more grim-looking Subaru and said,

Julius: [First, I would like to confirm. The girl named Louis, who is currently riding in this very dragon carriage, is it correct to say that she is indeed the same person as Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony?]

Roswaal: [――? What do you mean by that?]

Julius: [Emilia-sama and Lady Ram will know. Gluttony has the ability to replicate the powers of those it devours, changing its appearance to match that of its victim. In other words…]

Roswaal: [So, you're suggesting the possibility that the Louis we're talking about and the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony might not be the same person, but rather, one who was consumed by the other?]

At Julius's conjecture, Emilia and the others wore faces of surprise.

Indeed, considering the nature of Authority of Gluttony, it was not an improbable theory. If Gluttony could mimic the form of the person it consumed, it would make sense that the original, who was consumed, would still exist somewhere.

If this was true, then the existence of this Louis could be separated from that of Gluttony.

However――,

Subaru: […No, that's not likely. Louis, I believe, is reproducing the abilities of those she has devoured. It must be due to Gluttony's Authority.]

Julius: [I see. My apologies for such misleading speculation.]

Julius closed his eyes and apologized in response to Subaru's dismissal.

It was no fault of Julius. If his hypothesis were correct, Subaru would not be so troubled. But, they could not resort to temporarily evading the issue.

What they needed was not just an answer, but an answer derived from a shared understanding of the truth.

Louis had been transported alongside Subaru to the Vollachian Empire; and yet, despite being treated so harshly by Subaru, she struggled time and again to help him, was injured, and even put her life at risk.

It was her, Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, who was the same person as the Louis that they all knew. It would be a challenge to get everyone to acknowledge that she was an essential presence for the upcoming battle.

Subaru: [―― First, let me explain what happened with Louis and me in the Empire after I was sent there with Rem, before any of you came across Louis.]

Everyone: [――――]

Silently, everyone directed their attention toward him.

Under the scrutiny of his close comrades, Subaru unmistakably felt a sense of suffocation. It felt like a grading or a verification of answers was about to begin.

It was a verification of whether Louis could truly be accepted by his comrades for who she was.

Emilia: [Subaru, there's no need to rush.]

Emilia gently reassured Subaru, who was bracing himself for what was to come. Beatrice, by his side, gave his hand a gentle squeeze of affirmation.

Comforted by their consideration, Subaru took a deep breath and began his story.

Subaru: [The very first thing we noticed was a large forest far to the east――]

△▼△▼△▼△

He had intended to speak plainly, choosing his words to convey the facts as succinctly as possible.

Still, the things he had to talk about sprang forth like a gushing spring, making him acutely aware that the days he had to recount were filled with significant moments, despite the brevity of the time in question.

To begin with, a tremendous amount of trouble had occurred in just a short period.

All of it comprised accidents that endangered the lives of Subaru, Rem, and their companions, and, of course, Louis was inevitably involved in these.

Naturally. ――Yes, Indubitably indeed.

After all, Louis had been with Subaru and the others the entire time, enduring Subaru's hostility while receiving kindness from Rem, and she persevered without being discouraged by the harsh treatment from Subaru.

So――,

Subaru: [――Louis and I, with the help of Yorna-san, managed to win our bet against Olbart-san. It was with a bit of a cheat, though, as we changed the rules from hide-and-seek, to a game of tag.]

???: [――――]

Subaru: [After that, something unimaginable happened at Chaosflame, as you may have heard. The people living there miraculously survived and we were able to join up with Abel and his rebels. I lost consciousness there and got separated… You guys probably know more about what happened with Louis after that, right?]

Emilia:[――. Yes. We met Abel and the others when they came back to the destroyed Guaral, which happened right after.]

As Emilia nodded in confirmation of Subaru's statement, he finished his explanation and took a long breath.

Even though Subaru had intended not to take up too much time, in the end, the story lasted nearly an hour. He was grateful that during that time, his companions mostly refrained from interrupting and listened intently.

Inevitably, Subaru had to tell the story from his own perspective, but he tried to be as detached as possible in narrating the events.

With that in mind――,

Subaru: [As I've told you, there wasn’t any suspicious behavior from Louis while she was with me. I believe you can hear the same story from Rem.]

Otto: [We are not really doubting that. If we truly thought her suspicious, there is no way Ram-san would have allowed her to stay near Rem-san.]

When it comes to her family, and especially Rem, there's no need to mention the intensity of Ram's scrutiny.

In fact, the primary reason she overwhelmed Gluttony's Ley Batenkaitos at the Pleiades Watchtower was her profound objection to any interference with her relationship between Rem and herself.

Ram, who could go to such lengths for a sister she does not remember.

If she felt even the slightest hint of danger from Louis, it would have been unthinkable for her to leave Louis near Rem, who had just awakened.

Anastasia: […We’ve roughly grasped how tough it got for ya, Natsuki-kun.]

Anastasia, who had been silently listening until now, was massaging her brow with a finger, acknowledging the harshness of Subaru's journey.

Even for a woman as wise as she, the sequence of events presented a volume of information that took time and effort to fully digest. Having somehow swallowed it all down, Anastasia removed her finger from her forehead and,

Anastasia: [Sure, I'm curious ‘bout what happened to ya, Natsuki-kun, after ya lost consciousness in Demon City, but that ain’t the main subject right now.]

Subaru: [Yeah, right now, what's important is Louis. As I've said, Louis hasn't shown her dangerous side to us so far. And there's the prophecy of Ubilk, the 'Stargazer'… that's a factor too. So, in the upcoming battle, having Louis cooperate with us――]

Anastasia: [――’Bout this story, I wonder where exactly it’s headed, ain’t it?]

Just like that, her quiet interjection stopped Subaru's train of thought.

Anastasia, having voiced her thoughts, gently traced her lips with the finger that had been massaging her brow. Her intellectually vibrant aqua eyes seized Subaru's heart as she continued.

Anastasia: [I ain’t against yer idea of usin’ everythin’ at our disposal, Natsuki-kun. Even Meili-san, who helped us cross the Augria Sand Dunes, was originally an enemy. If we're makin’ such distinctions, then the same applies to that girl.]

Subaru: [That's, well, the same, right? Meili and Louis should be in the same position.]

Anastasia: [No, it ain’t the case. ――I'm sure, everyone but ya, Natsuki-kun, would think so.]

Subaru: [――Hk.]

Confronted with that calm assertion, Subaru looked around at the others in surprise.

Anastasia's words echoed in Subaru's mind as he scanned everyone's faces, hoping that someone would disagree.

However, not one of them met his expectations.

Subaru: [Everyone…]

Otto: [Since no one seems willing to say it, I will.]

Among the group, all wearing grave expressions, Otto raised his hand without changing his countenance.

However, his unchanging demeanor did not denote a lack of emotional response, but was the mere reflection of his calmness, sustained since the start of the meeting.

Neither his gaze nor his voice were unconditionally supportive of Subaru.

Otto: [I agree with Anastasia-sama. The situation with her and Meili-chan is different. They are not in the same position.]

Subaru: [Otto!]

Otto: [I will take it upon myself to say what no one else seems to want to. ――It is because she is a Sin Archbishop.]

Otto answered Subaru, whose voice had inadvertently risen, with a calm tone.

Anticipating Subaru's question, Otto's response was as fitting as it could possibly be for the reason why none present could side with Subaru.

Beatrice: [Subaru, Betty wants to stand by Subaru, in fact. That girl ...Louis, that the girl has no ill will is a believable story, too, I suppose. But...]

Roswaal: [The fact is, Gluttony's victims include us. Not to mention, considering that the damage is not easily apparent, I wonder what the extent of the potential victims are, riiight.]

Julius: [Though there's no way to confirm it... the regret of those who lost themselves, forgotten by others, and couldn't return while having nowhere to rely on, I can empathize with that feeling deeply.]

Following up on the concerned Beatrice, Roswaal and Julius expressed genuine opinions from those affected by Gluttony's Authority, both victims and those who had suffered its consequences

???: [――――]

Roswaal and Julius were correct, those who know they have been affected are comparatively better off.

Truly, there must be many victims who could do nothing but despair, having lost their "Names" and "Memories," and left without a place to return, unable to be saved.

And thus, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, who had created numerous victims――,

Emilia: [Everyone, surely this is unbelievable.]

Subaru: [Emilia...]

Emilia: [It's not like that... I don't think I can forgive her.]

Subaru's explanation was not lacking, nor did his feelings not get through to them.

Emilia's words, with her eyebrows furrowed, shattered Subaru's heart as she explained that the real problem wasn't there.

Knowing about Louis' time with Subaru, and knowing what happened after Subaru's absence, Emilia and the others knew that the "Current" Louis was not a threat to them.

Having understood that, the issue at hand were the actions in Louis’s past.

Anastasia: [Mistakes like that... they'll never just disappear.]

Subaru: [――hk.]

Quietly, Anastasia murmured those words.

Once before, it was a despairing warning that had frozen Natsuki Subaru, shattering him to pieces.

The fact that those words were thrown at him had already taken root within Subaru. And once again, they were delivered from her mouth to Subaru's ears, changing the course of events.

Anastasia: [No matter how much Natsuki-kun tries to convince us that that child is harmless, it doesn't erase what harm she did. The victims remain victims... It's not a superficial problem that can be brushed aside with pretenses.]

Subaru: [――Uh.]

Anastasia: [First off, don't you think it'd be better to get back all the "Names" and "Memories" that have been eaten so far? Even if you try to proceed without them, wouldn't Natsuki-kun be dissatisfied with that?]

Anastasia's cutting words sliced through the stiffened Subaru one after another.

All of their arguments were valid, but the one that caused the greatest pain was the final point――that they hadn't even built the foundation for deciding Louis's fate by returning the "Memories" and "Names" that had been taken.

That was the crucial premise leading to what Emilia had said, "I can’t forgive her."

Roswaal: [Well, His Excellency the Emperor is aware of the prophecy Subaru-kun heard. Saying that we won't let Louis cooperate in the battle is just not realistic, riiight~?]

Garfiel: [Huh? What are you talkin’ about? Speak clearly.]

Roswaal: [It’s troubling being hit with your agitation but... no matter how our discussion ends, the plan to involve the girl won't change. The only thing left is our treatment of her afterwards.]

Subaru: [Treatment…?]

Subaru's heart grew impatient with Roswaal, who still continued with his roundabout way of talking after being told to speak clearly. In response to Subaru's earnest gaze, Roswaal shrugged his shoulders and spoke.

That was- -,

Roswaal: [It’s a matter of how we can convince her to cooperaaate~. For instance, we could promise her amnesty once we overcome this crisis threatening the empire. And then, once everything's done, we quietly execute the appropriate punishment for her crimes. This is the best way to handle it without any future problems.]

Garfiel: [――hk, don't mess around!]

In response to Roswaal's cunning plan, Garfiel clicked his fangs and snapped at him. He glared fiercely at Roswaal and,

Garfiel: [You're telling me the other guy's a villain, There's no way I'll stoop to this level! I won't be danglin any bait to get her help, no way I'll approve of that!]

Roswaal: [Oh, really? You know, I think Otto-kun was thinking the same thing…]

Garfiel: [ Don’t put yourself in the same opinion as Ottobro!]

Otto: [――Margrave's is speaking for most people. We shouldn't grant amnesty to the Sin Archbishop. Or rather.]

There, Otto paused for a moment and gazed fixedly at Subaru.

At Subaru he gulped under his gaze, he continued mercilessly.

Otto: [Is Natsuki-san trying to create a precedent where Sin Archbishops are forgiven?]

Subaru: [――Hk, I don't intend on doing anything like that. In this world, there are villains who mustn't be forgiven.The Sin Archbishops of the Witch Cult are definitely one of them.]

Petelgeuse, Regulus, the brothers Roy, and Ley, Sirius, Capella; Every Sin Archbishop Subaru had encountered up until now were all invariably far beyond redemption.

They were beings who would not hesitate to sacrifice others to satisfy their own desires.

However――,

Otto: [――Are you saying only Louis Arneb is different?]

Subaru: [That, well…]

Otto's query, it attempted to lay bare the depths of Subaru's heart.

Sin Archbishops could be forgiven. Not just Otto, but everyone drew this line, something Subaru could clearly understand.

Yet the insistence on putting Louis in a separate category, as Otto put it, was indeed strange.

Everyone: [――――]

Under the scrutiny of everyone's gaze, Subaru once again questioned himself.

Subaru, what did he want to do with Louis? They harbored great hatred for each other in the Hall of Memories, and Subaru chose not to save her as she suffered from the aftermath of Return by Death. He did not think that choice was wrong. Even if the same situation arose again, he would probably make the same decision.

However, at the same time, he knew Louis who had shared hardships with him in the Vollachian Empire.

He had witnessed her risk her life multiple times to save him, and the fact that she had actually died was deeply engraved in his soul.

Somewhere along the way, Subaru's vigilance had been melted away by Louis' earnestness――,

Emilia: [How?]

Subaru: [――――]

Suddenly, a quiet question was posed to Subaru, who was deep in thought.

As he opened his closed eyelids, he found himself looking directly into Emilia's amethyst eyes. She narrowed her long-lashed eyes and repeated the same question once more.

That was――-,

Emilia: [How did Subaru come to think that way?]

Subaru: [How, you ask…]

Emilia: [You hated the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony a lot, didn't you, Subaru? You thought you couldn't forgive her. So, why now?]

Subaru: [That's because… didn't I already tell you? She… Louis, in this Empire with us…]

They had shared many hardships, and Louis had bravely tried to protect Subaru and Rem.

The events in the Empire had left a deep impression on Subaru, as much as or even more than the unforgivable enemy she had been thought to be in the Hall of Memories. That was why.

That was why Natsuki Subaru's feelings towards Louis had changed.

Julius: [Subaru, let me once again convey a harsh truth to you.]

Julius said this in a low voice to Subaru, who was struggling to answer Emilia's question.

The preamble of a harsh truth made Subaru brace himself. Julius traced the scar under his left eye with his finger and addressed the prepared Subaru.

Julius: [Humanity in this world will never forgive the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, the girl known as Louis Arneb. Whether it be the Kingdom or the Empire, you can say it is the consensus of the world.]

Subaru: [――――]

Julius: [Even if she were to flee to any corner of the world, there is no place where she would be pardoned. Those who commit crimes must be punished. And the Sin Archbishop is a criminal whose sins can only be atoned for with her life.]

There was no falsehood in that preamble of the harsh truth.

Julius decisively pronounced it in a clear, strong tone, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

There was no place in this world where Louis Arneb could live and be forgiven.

At those heavy words, Subaru was left unable to respond.

However――,

Julius : [I too, desire nothing but death for the Sin Archbishop. The Death of the beings we consider enemies of the world. That is the most I can hope for.]

Subaru: […What?]

Otto: [Julius Juukulius!!]

The person who had raised their voice sharply, glaring at Julius, was Otto.

Subaru, who had widened his eyes unable to comprehend the added words, was left aside as Otto and Julius locked eyes.

Julius' gaze was filled with pain, while Otto's was bitter; their eyes wounded each other.

Otto: [For you, an outsider, to say that is utterly outrageous…!]

Julius: [I am sorry, but that perception is not accurate. I am also one of the parties involved. I am in a position to voice my opinion, so allow me to exercise that right.]

Otto: [――Hk!]

Gritting his teeth, Otto's glare towards Julius intensified.

Despite knowing he was no match in terms of military might, he could stand his ground in terms of insight. Julius, too, closed one eye at the strength of Otto's will and let out a small sigh.

Subaru: [Nothing but Death for the Sin Archbishop’s, huh…]

Amid the back-and-forth between the two, with a feeling as if a part of his brain had gone numb, Subaru muttered so.

What Julius had tried to say, and why the perceptive Otto had snapped at him. Hidden within that exchange was something more than just the words that Subaru had failed to notice.

Nothing but the Death of the Sin Archbishop was desired. The world would not forgive Louis Arneb.

The Sin Archbishop, Louis Arneb, the world――.

Subaru: [――Ah.]

Beatrice: [Subaru, let’s talk about Betty, in fact.]

The moment he felt the sensation of a slight breeze blowing across the labyrinth of thoughts, Beatrice spoke up.

With round eyes in which their distinctive pattern was floating, she looked up at Subaru,

Beatrice: [Betty happened to run into the Sin Archbishop Louis back in Pristella, I suppose. After that, this time when we happened to meet in the Empire, the thought about that girl's situation was this, in fact. ――That she’s like a different person, I suppose.]

Subaru: [――――]

Beatrice: [That girl, she's different from the Sin Archbishop Betty knows, in fact. How was she from Subaru’s point of view, I suppose. From Subaru’s point of view, who had argued with the Sin Archbishop up close.]

Beatrice’s kind, yet inescapable words questioned him.

He understood what she meant. For Subaru, it was something he did not admit because he did not want to admit it. 

That the “Louis” right now, and the Louis Arneb he had met in the Hall of Memories, seemed to be different people.

However, just as he had rebutted Julius' question, "Louis" had been using her authority. Like Gluttony, she was able to freely manipulate the powers of her eaten victims.

“Louis” still had the Authority of Gluttony, but her consciousness alone was reborn.

That was like――,

Subaru: [Like me, when I had lost my memories.]

If that was the case, had “Louis” been suffering all this time?

Like Subaru back then, who had chased after the phantom of “Natsuki Subaru” and was troubled and distressed at being unable to trust anyone around him, was “Louis” also seeking help?

Even if that was the case, “Louis” had still helped Subaru and Rem make it to where they were today.

And then――,

Emilia: [――I, I have been thinking about this for a while. If you do something bad, I thought that there was no way to ever take it back.] 

Subaru: [Emilia…]

Emilia: [You apologize, make amends, and even then are told that it’s not enough, sometimes you get fed up with apologizing and making amends, right? So, I've been thinking about a way to prevent that… but it’s not easy to find such a great solution. However.]

Subaru: [However?]

Emilia: [There is one, a method that might work. A method that Subaru taught me.]

Emilia placed her hand against her chest, and she carefully chose words that could fully convey her emotions.

The words that she had spoken, Subaru searched for them in his own heart. However, among the things Subaru had taught Emilia, as for something that could be applied to this moment, nothing came to mind.

To Subaru, who had no idea what to expect, Emilia, with kind eyes, said, 

Emilia: [About such a person, more than thinking “I will not forgive them”, it’s about thinking “I want them to be happy.”]

Subaru: [――――]

Emilia: [For the people around, many, many of them, to think “I want that person to be happy.” I think for us to forgive that child, it’s necessary that we be made to think that way.]

Emilia's words slowly and gently seeped into Subaru's heart.

How to forgive a sinner. How to forgive sin. A means of salvation that might lie beyond apologizing and making amends, that was the earnestly thought out answer that Emilia had given. 

From where Subaru had learned that, or when he had taught it to her, he had no idea.

But, it felt like those words had fallen firmly into Subaru’s heart with a thump.

Why was it that Subaru cared so much for the Sin Archbishop, for “Louis”?

It was because “Louis” had done more for Subaru than what was perpetrated by Louis.

Therefore――,

Anastasia: [Once more, lemme ask ya the same thing.]

Hearing Emilia's words and Subaru's faint sigh, Anastasia said this.

While stroking Eridna who was wrapped around her neck, she looked at Subaru and Emilia in turn, and said.

Anastasia: [――Jus’ where are ya goin’ with this conversation?]

So she declared.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Aau?]

Rem let out a long, deep sigh as she cupped Louis's face between her hands, who was looking at her curiously.

That reaction of Rem's made Louis look more and more puzzled as her cheeks were being sandwiched.

From the girl's demeanor, Rem reflected that she must have caused her to worry.

Upon reflection, however――,

Rem: [Haa…]

???: [That's quite the sigh, Rem. What's the matter?]

Rem: [Nee-sama…]

As she sighed heavily, a gentle voice called out to her from beside her.

It was Ram, who had returned to the guest room to which she had been assigned, with tea that was prepared by her. Behind her, she was accompanied by a girl with antlers―― her name was Tanza, Rem thought.

Noticing Rem's gaze, Ram nodded and said, "So,"

Ram: [It looked like she was having a hard time just standing around, so here she is.]

Tanza: [It is not that I do not have anything to do…]

Ram: [Really? There was a look of dissatisfaction on your face when they kept you away from those loudmouths. Even the Empire has ideas like wanting to fight to protect women and children. To think it was something even more absurd than that.]

Rem: [N-nee-sama, that is a bit of an exaggeration…]

Rem's cheeks tightened slightly at her sister's rather blunt statement.

It took time for Rem to digest her sister's words, but even so, the appeal was honest from the root of her soul, and Rem could feel her heart-stirring with every move she made.

Regardless, Tanza was not happy with the way Ram had put it.

Tanza: [It is true that many of the people in the battalion, especially Cecilus-sama, think of things simply, but some of them are as sharp-witted as the Governor.]

Rem: [Right. So, you're staying behind with this sharp-witted Governor?]

Tanza: [――. No, it was Schwartz-sama who had asked me to stay behind and rest.]

Louis: [U.]

Tanza, the edges of her mouth slightly stiffened at Rem's turn of phrase. Immediately, Louis, whose cheeks were sandwiched by Rem, moaned as the pressure of her hands grew stronger.

"I'm sorry", Rem said as she apologized to Louis.

Rem: [That was an accident. Are you all right, Louis-chan?]

Louis: [Auu… Uau?]

Rem: […No, it's not related at all.]

Louis: [Uu.]

Louis had a doubtful look on her face upon hearing Rem's answer, her cheeks still sandwiched by Rem.

When she looked away from Louis, her eyes met Ram's, who had just been serving the tea. She placed a cup of warm, fragrant tea in front of Rem,

Ram: [Even though it's the Empire's secret dragon carriage, it's not as well-stocked with tea leaves as you'd expect. It doesn't taste too great, but it'll keep you warm.]

Rem: [T-thank you. I appreciate it.]

Ram: [So? Did Barusu do something disrespectful to you?]

Rem: [Pfft.]

Finally releasing Louis's cheek, as soon as she put her mouth on the tea, she sputtered it out. As Rem quickly put down the cup, Louis tried to wipe her face with her sleeve.

Rem: [I'm fine, it's all right, Louis-chan… Um, what is it, Nee-sama?]

Ram: [Nothing at all. Barusu's behavior is usually rude and inconsiderate. Even if it's a guess, chances are good that that is the reason why Rem's face looks so gloomy.]

Rem: [That's also a bit of an oversimplification, no matter how you say it…]

In the end, Rem breathed a sigh of relief as Louis wiped her face, thinking that it was just a wild guess. However, that reaction was enough for the perceptive Ram to guess the cause of her sigh.

Sitting cross-legged just in front of her, Ram stared at Rem as she tilted her cup.

Under this silent pressure, Rem soon relented and confessed.

Rem: [Um, about Emilia-san.]

Ram: [Emilia-sama? Yes, Emilia-sama is also clueless and inconsiderate, isn't she? Is that why Rem's face was so gloomy?]

Rem: [N-no, that's not it! I was just wondering what the relationship between him… between Natsuki Subaru, and Emilia-san is…]

Rem succeeded in asking the question while keeping her voice as quiet and as calm as possible.

However, at this time, Rem did not realize that the very choice of topic was enough to make Ram's light-crimson eyes narrow.

But, her astute-looking older sister whispered, "Indeed,"

Ram: [Good, Barusu should be cut to pieces. Let's do it together later.]

Rem: [Nee-sama!?]

Ram: [Hehe, it's a sisterly collaboration. Barusu can be useful sometimes.]

The older sister, who smiled faintly, was beautiful to behold, but her remarks were extremely disturbing. And after hearing Ram's remarks, it was Tanza who quickly stood up.

She took a sip of the tea that had been brewed for her too, and, surprised at the taste,  with a "Wow," said,

Tanza: [Is that not a bit of a disingenuous statement? I assume that "Barusu"… is referring to Schwartz-sama. But, if you are going to mess with Schwartz-sama, I and the rest of the battalion will not forgive you.]

Ram: [That's quite the spirited response… Tanza, how old are you?]

Tanza: [――? I will be twelve this year.]

Ram: [That seems right. That was convincing.]

Tanza: [I am not convinced, even if you are convinced I am.]

Rem agreed with Tanza's disgruntled opinion.

Why was Ram convinced when she had heard Tanza's age? To begin with, Ram did not even answer Rem's question, right?

Um, what kind of relationship does that girl Emilia have with Subaru?

Rem: […They were, awfully close.]

So, when asked what it was all about, all Rem could say was, "Ha?." However, Rem had a lot of thoughts about how close the two of them were.

That being the case, Rem preferred to resolve this as soon as possible so she could focus on her remaining issues.

Yes, Rem's issue, that it was―― Rem's issue, setting that aside.

Rem: [That's right. It's just a minor issue that needs to be taken care of quickly so that I can face the bigger issues. Nothing more, nothing less.]

???: [――Rem, you got a minute?]

Rem: [Ha!?]

With a loud clang, Rem unexpectedly stood up on the spot. This caused Rem to unexpectedly pick up Louis, who was on Rem's lap.

Rem lifted Louis up, who in her surprise let out an "Auu!" Rem yet again apologized to Louis, and looked toward the door of the guest room, in the direction where she was called from,

Rem: [W-who is it?]

Ram: [Who is it? It's Barusu, the one to be torn to pieces. ――It seems that the discussion is over.]

Rem: [Ah…]

At Ram's words, as she gracefully tasted the tea, Rem let out a small sigh and hugged Louis. With an "Au?", Louis twisted her head, and Rem closed her eyes as she buried the tip of her nose into her golden hair.

Just before, Rem was present when the coupled dragon carriage was almost attacked, but afterward, she did not join the discussion where Abel had taken Subaru with a serious look on his face.

Of course, there was also the fact that it was not helpful to get mixed up in an important conversation, and there was the small issue that she had confirmed to herself earlier that still stuck with her.

But, the biggest reason was――,

Louis: [U?]

Louis, in her arms, was the cause of this unwanted unease.

Rem did not know why, but her heart told her that she needed to be there for Louis. And so, as Rem retreated to the guest room――,

Tanza: [――Schwartz-sama, come in.]

Subaru: [Ah, thanks. So… Tanza was here too?]

Tanza: [Yes, since Schwartz-sama pushed me to stay away in collaboration with everyone.]

Subaru: [Somehow, something about the way you put it  makes me feel guilty…]

So while Rem was flustered, Tanza instead welcomed the visitor into the room.

When Tanza lashed out in resentment at the visitor, the person who entered scratched his head in a troubled manner. Even though his stature has shrunk, the atmosphere of his troubled profile has not changed much.

It was probably because even if they grew a little taller, they still had a childish look about their face that could not be wiped away.

Ram: [Despite the mean looking eyes, he's a peculiar person…]

Subaru: [Huh!? Did someone just say something bad about my eyes? I heard you, didn't I?]

Ram: [It's quite a feat, to see that the complaints of the people of the Kingdom of Lugunica could be heard across the border.]

Subaru: [There ain't no way the whole Kingdom is talking about my eyes! They're talking about dinner tonight and plans for tomorrow and how happy they are, I bet!]

In response to Ram's teasing, Subaru strode into the room with a great deal of swagger.

Somehow, unable to look at Subaru, Rem hid her face behind Louis, whom she was holding in her arms, and did not face him directly.

Instead, Louis took her place with Subaru and said, "Uau".

Subaru: [Yo, Louis, I wanted to see you too, do you know where Rem is?]

Louis: [Aauu.]

Subaru: [I see, so you don't know. Damn it. I had something important to tell her…]

Rem: [――. If you have something important to say, please don't joke around and get to the point.]

Subaru: [Whoa, Rem! You were behind Louis! I didn't notice!]

Subaru reacted in an exaggerated and deliberate manner when Rem interrupted him. However, such deliberateness seemed to have worked on Louis, and Louis shrugged her shoulders in disappointment that she could not hide Rem from him.

Rem's eyes narrowed as she lowered Louis to the floor and stroked her head to comfort her.

Rem: […Maybe, you're overdoing it?]

Subaru: [――――]

Rem: [I think I’ve said it before. Please don't overdo it like that. You're not so reckless to carry such a burden. You are not a hero who can do anything.]

Subaru's attitude just before, felt like it was some kind of pretense, and Rem quoted the same words that she had told him before.

Subaru's eyes widened at those words, although then, he quickly smirked and said,

Subaru: [No, amazingly, I'm objectively <u>Superman</u>, so I'm grateful for your opinion, Rem, and I'll just accept your cute voice.]

Rem: [Please don't joke around.]

Subaru: [I'm not joking. ――Rem, I have something important to tell you about Louis.]

Subaru stated so straightforwardly with an expression that corrected his manner and erased his smirk.

Hearing this, Rem gasps, and instead Ram sighs beside their exchange,

Ram: [Barusu, will Ram and Tanza take our leave?]

Subaru: [Nah, both Neesama and Tanza can stay. You can be there to represent the big sister side, and Tanza can be there to represent the loli side.]

Ram: [You mean Ram is a better older sister than Frederica. Of course.]

Tanza: [Um, what does the "loli" side mean…?]

Requested to be present, Ram puffed out her chest and Tanza cocked her head.

Then, Rem gently pulled Louis closer to Subaru's gaze as Subaru turned towards them again. Holding the back of Louis's head to her chest, Rem stared at Subaru.

And then――,

Subaru: [Let's resolve this. This, lovely relationship that we don't really understand.]
