*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [――The enemy has been identified. It’s Sphinx… the Witch’s defective creation that had once wreaked havoc in the kingdom, the worst kind of monster.]

An emergency meeting had been convened once again in the linked dragon carriages, and Roswaal, who had rushed back from the battlefield, looked towards everyone assembled and explained. 

Sphinx―― that was the name of the fake Ryuzu that Subaru and the others had faced. 

Also――,

???: [You said it wreaked havoc in the kingdom, when was this?"]

Roswaal: [――Approximately forty years ago, in the midst of the Demi-Human War.]

???: [――Hk!]

At Roswaal's response, Subaru's eyes widened in surprise.

The Demi-Human War was an incident that frequently came up in conversation, but it was an event that had taken place exclusively within the Kingdom of Lagunica, the stage for the civil war. To think that it would be heard of, even within the Vollachian Empire.

Roswaal: [As per the records, during the Demi-Human War, Sphinx was one among the three people who required the most caution on the demi-human side. I've heard that her deep knowledge of magic significantly escalated the horrors of the war.] 

???: [I think I came across that name while studying the history of the Kingdom. Also, the name Subaru mentioned as well... Valga Cromwell, right?]

???: [――. Yes. That name also corresponds to one of the individuals who warranted caution.]

Having actually confronted the fake Ryuzu―― Sphinx, Emilia and Julius, who had experienced the threat she posed, also discussed the other name that had been mentioned at that time.

To them, it must have seemed like Subaru had suddenly thrown out that name, but by judging from Sphinx's reaction to it, they understood that she and the named individual were not unrelated.

Then again, Subaru himself was unaware that it was the name of a person involved with the Demi-Human War. 

Subaru: [So, our enemies are Sphinx and this Valga Cromwell guy, they had gone on a rampage during the Demi-Human War, and now they are on a rampage in the Empire too? I don’t get it…]

???: [That Demi-Human War was over forty years ago wasn’t it. I’ve also learnt the history of the Kingdom, I know ‘bout the arguments from the demi-human side durin’ the civil war… ’n I feel this situation doesn’t fit.]

Subaru: [I know right. Anyway, I’m just glad that Beako and the others are safe…]

Subaru and Anastasia both nod their heads at the inconsistency of the situation in which Sphinx and Valga, two people who had once run amok in the kingdom, were now on a rampage in the Empire.

At this rate, it seemed likely that the last of the three people to be wary of from the civil war, would also turn out to be an enemy.

???: [That’s impossible, in fact. The last one… named Libre Fermi, was confirmed to be in the library of the Pleiades Watchtower, I suppose. He is definitely counted among the dead, in fact.]

 Saying so, Beatrice, who was standing snuggly beside Subaru, negated his worry. 

Ever since hearing about the predicament in which Subaru and the others had found themselves in, Beatrice, who had literally flown back with Roswaal, had firmly resolved to not leave Subaru’s side.

For Subaru as well, the thought of letting her go back to the battlefield was heartrending, so he was more than willing to accept Beatrice’s cute resolve.

Anyhow――,

Subaru: [If the Book of the Dead is there, then we can rest easy… I wonder if it’s okay to say that. Rather, since we are dealing with zombies, I’m starting to feel that it being there is a given.]

Julius: [If that is the case, it’s a terrifying situation. The ones we are dealing with may not be ordinary zombies, there is a possibility of facing the kind of heroes or villains who have made a mark on history.]   

Subaru: [Heroes from history, huh…? You’re not finding this exciting, are you?]

Julius: [Regrettably, I have already confronted Reid Astera. So I am disciplining myself to not hold excessive expectations.]

Julius shrugged his shoulders, when Subaru gave him a suspicious look.

In fact, Julius’s nerdy obsession with history had become evident when the topic of Reid had come up in the tower. He had properly settled matters with Reid. He was not the kind of man who backslid, but his remark implying that he could keep his composure when facing an eminent figure had to be taken with a grain of salt. 

???: [This is not the time to say that… For the time being, Natsuki-san’s team prevented one of the opponent's trump cards from being played, but it was not perfect. The good news is that Sphinx, who would have been a formidable opponent, dropped out early, but…]

???: [Sorry, Ottobro. Actually, I can’t say that.]

???: [Huh?]

Otto widened his eyes as Garfiel, whose arms were crossed and fangs clenched, as he told him abruptly. Garfiel, his whole body covered with dirt from the battlefield, stared fixedly at Otto as he pointed at Beatrice and Roswaal with each hand,

Garfiel: [This Sphinx gal was in front of me, Beatrice ‘n the others. That look of hers. I was pissed off, like, are ya kiddin’ me…?]

Emilia: [Yeah, that’s right. She has the same face as Ryuzu-san. That must have been reaaally hard for Garfiel.]

Garfiel: [Well, if she ain't my granny, she ain't my granny, no matter how much she looks like her. So I didn’t hesitate to fight her. The problem was after that.]

Emilia: [After that?]

Garfiel nodded deeply to Emilia, who tilted her head.

For once, his brave countenance clouded over, and with a sigh he said,

Garfiel: [――Our amazin’ selves definitely took down that Sphinx. I saw her shatter before my eyes, That was…]

Beatrice: [That was the aim of Sphinx, I suppose.]

Taking over Garfiel's conclusion, Beatrice squeezed Subaru's hand tightly.

She gripped Subaru’s fingers so tightly that they turned white, indicating the extent of the shock that Sphinx's aim brought to Beatrice.

Narrowing his eyes at Beatrice, Roswaal continued, “Allow me to conclude,”

Roswaal: [Sphinx certainly died in front of us, she also died in the same way in the past, before Subaru-kun and this group. What can be inferred from this is simple and clear… Sphinx can die multiple times, meaning that each time she dies, she can be resurrected as a zombie.]

Subaru: [Wha…!?]

Roswaal: [To compound the worst of it, the next resurrected zombie will likely be aware of her previous death and the circumstances that caused it. In other words, she knows that Subaru-kun and Halibel-dono were the factors that stopped her plan to blow away the coupled dragon carriage.]

Everyone: [――――]

Roswaal explained a dreadful thought at the very end.

However, there were many parts they could agree with. In the midst of the destructive light that poured down, Sphinx did not seem the least bit distraught, all while being exposed to a blow that would turn her to dust.

There were people who remained unfazed, even when facing their own death.

However, if Sphinx's lack of reaction to Death was because she had not considered it to be Death, it made sense to Subaru.

Subaru: [It’s as if…]

――She was using Return by Death, Subaru thought, though he did not say it out loud.

Losing one’s own life would not be considered a detriment, rather, it could be a devastating weapon. The functional difference was the fact that death itself would not disappear.

Come to think of it, it may have been more similar to the troublesome "possession" ability of Petelgeuse, who they once fought against, than Subaru's Return by Death.

Julius: [It doesn’t matter how many times she is defeated, huh?]

For a moment, the gazes of Julius, who muttered that, and Subaru met.

Perhaps Julius, like Subaru, had the same thoughts of comparing Sphinx’s troublesome ability to Petelgeuse’s. Unlike Petelgeuse, Sphinx did not "possess" others. This could perhaps be called "Escape by Death"――,

Subaru: [If you can't defeat them no matter how many times you try, then there is one way to defeat such a person: just keep defeating them until they run out of spare lives, that's it.]

???: [Spare lives? Eeh, that is…]

Subaru: [It means the remaining number of times they can come back to life. No matter how dangerous the opponent is, there's no way they can revive as many times as they want without limit. There is definitely a limit. Right?]

At the risk of him playing innocent, the remaining lives would eventually run out at some point.

If they killed Sphinx until she ran out of lives, her otherwise composed face, despite the fact that she might have thought she could not die, would no longer be able to keep her composure.

Subaru: [So that's why we don't have to stay in the dumps. Let's just be happy we knocked them down a peg, thanks, Rem!]

Rem: [――! I, I didn't do anything that important.]

When suddenly prompted, Rem shook her head. However, she is too modest to say that she did something important.

Immediately upon using Return by Death, Subaru exited the coupled dragon carriage accompanied by Emilia and Julius, and asked her to convey a message to those who remained. ――To go to the most powerful of Kararagi.

Subaru: [If Rem hadn't went and got Halibel-san, I, Emilia, Julius, and the coupled dragon carriages would all be dust by now. If that had happened, Beako would be a widow who lost me, and a nun who would be mourning me forever.]

Beatrice: [Don't so casually say the worst possible thing happening to you, It’s something unthinkable, in fact! If you die Subaru and leave Betty behind, and Betty will really be that "Nun", I suppose!]

Emilia: [Hm, I guess it's thanks to Rem that Beatrice didn't become this "Nun" and that we can talk like this. Thank you.]

Rem: […I, understand. At least, I think I do.]

Rem was somewhat reserved in accepting the thanks from both Beatrice, who was almost in tears, and Emilia, who was smiling.

The sight of Emilia, Beatrice, and Rem all together again made Subaru's heart swell with emotion, and he turned his gaze to the tall figure standing there,

Subaru: [Of course, thanks, Halibel-san. To be honest, I was just banking on the reputation of Halibel-san's name to see if you could do something about it…]

Halibel: [Haha, it's good to be honest, isn't it? In fact, I was also surprised when I was suddenly called by the young blue Oni lady. I felt like I would have died too if not for her.]

Halibel laughed and had an attitude that was not befitting of his accomplishments.

His laid-back tone lacked a sense of urgency, but without him, Subaru and the others would have been annihilated. It was a good decision by Subaru to have called him on the second time, but it was horrifying to think if he had not been there in this coupled dragon carriage in the first place.

In that short time, all of the combatants on board the dragon carriage gathered together and had to find the best solution. Even so, there was no certainty that there would be a solution, so it was truly a variety for the strongest of the City-States.

Anastasia: [You say that, but how did you actually do that?]

Emilia: [Yeah, Julius and I did our best, but I think we came up a little short, so I'm reaaally glad that Anastasia-san had Halibel-san on our side.]

Anastasia: [I see, I see. Well, then it was worth spending all that money to get him to come with us.]

Quietly, Emilia and Anastasia also re-assessed Halibel, who lacked a sense of urgency and, in any case, was able to reflect on the situation because everybody had taken the best possible action.

That was Subaru's takeaway from the incredible assault just before――,

Subaru: [So, that's how the whole mess went down earlier. Well, that was fast, and all of us did our best to save everybody's life, you know. And of course, there's something to be said for that, right?]

???: [It was quite the accomplishment]

Subaru: [You bastard…!]

When the Emperor, Abel, who had been quietly listening to the report up to this point, expressed his gratitude, Natsuki Subaru shook his fist enthusiastically.

△▼△▼△▼△

Naturally, the Sphinx's “Escape by Death” strategy, which she used when attacking the coupled dragon carriage, needed to be shared with the imperial leaders who were unknowingly involved.

The Vollachian Empire's coupled dragon carriage was supposed to be a considerably important, highly classified secret, since the valuable vehicle would have been destroyed in part because it was needed, a concrete explanation was necessary.

Although――,

Subaru: [While that situation was dealt with, you can’t wrap this up with just a ceremonial comment…]

Goz: [What are you saying, Natsuki-dono! How could you ask for a reward better than a word of gratitude from His Excellency! You should feel ashamed as a subject of the Empire governed by His Excellency!!]

Emilia: [Goz-san! Make no mistake! Subaru is not a child of the Empire, but of the Kingdom like us!]

Subaru: [Emilia, you’re getting wound up again and your voice is getting loud.]

Unlike the Imperial soldiers, who were loyal to the MAX, Abel's words of gratitude were not enough of a reward for Subaru.

Subaru's dissatisfaction might have been compensated for by words of gratitude from Emilia, whose voice had been raised by Goz.

Vincent: [Currently, having been driven out of the Imperial Capital, we are enroute to reestablishing our readiness. Even if a reward commensurate with your work were demanded, I shall not make empty promises. Therefore, other than words, there is no prize to wear.]

Subaru: [Don’t tell me so proudly that your wallet is empty…! Boohooo, Anastasia-saan!]

Anastasia: [Yes, yes, no need to make a fuss over it. I'll make sure Julius, Emilia-san and Subaru get their share from the Empire.]

Subaru: [Alriiight! Rip ‘em off!]

Subaru raised his hands at Anastasia's dependability in tears, and Abel made a sullen face before sighing,

Vincent: [Is this undead in question…Sphinx, at the center of this "Great Disaster"?

Roswaal: [At the very least, she muuust~ be the one that cast the spell that revived the swarm of zombies. Alteration and improvement of existing spells, that's what that failure would do.]

Emilia: [Roswaal, I know you hate her, but don't use such unpleasant language.]

Roswaal responded to Abel, and Emilia raised her eyebrows slightly at his statement. She intensely stared at Roswaal with her gentle amethyst eyes,

Emilia: [We don't want to badmouth each other, do we? Even if you do something nice, if you keep saying things you don't like, no one will be able to hear how you really feel.]

Roswaal: [――. Yes, I'll keep that in mind.]

Emilia: [Good, thanks.]

Roswaal gave a wry smile as he bowed his head in a straightforward manner to the smiling Emilia's statement.

Subaru felt that Emilia's way of thinking grew more sophisticated while her gentle nature remained unchanged. Hopefully, Roswaal felt the same thing.

And, leaving Subaru's thoughts aside――,

Vincent: [I heard that Sphinx went on the rampage during the Kingdom's civil war. How did that end?"

Roswaal: [Kingdom records state that Sphinx, Valga Cromwell, and Libre Fermi were all killed before the civil war concluded. The loss of these three determined the demi-human side's disadvantage in the civil war… So I recall.]

Vincent: [I see. ――However, undead cannot just sprout from the ground without cause. Is it not the Kingdom's fault that the they become undead and ravage the lands of the Empire?]

Roswaal: [Well, well, Emperor Vincent, you're saying something very wrrrong.]

Roswaal shrugged with a smile at Abel's question, with one eye closed.

He indicates the view outside the window with his hand,

Roswaal: [We don't know anything about the depths of their thoughts, but it is clear that they have a different agenda than when they brought disaster to the empire, not to the kingdom, where they have the memory of defeat. Considering their silence for the past forty years, it is not realistic to think that the kingdom's record is wrong.]

Having said all that, Roswaal moved his hand back from pointing outside and held up one finger, and then said, "however",

Roswaal: [If there was anyone who participated directly in the demi-human war and had the opportunity to kill Sphinx, but failed to do so, I believe he or she should be blamed, as you saaay.]

Vincent: [Idiotic. It is not worth having a discussion with an old soldier who participated in the Kingdom's civil war forty years ago and decided the outcome of the war there.]

Subaru: [Well, that's right. For a start, I'm relieved you're not that unreasonable guy…  huh? What's the matter, Beako, you're making a ugly face.]

Beatrice: […Betty’s face is always adorable, I suppose.]

Roswaal's contention was a good one, and Abel quickly conceded and retracted the point.

Such restraint would probably be a habit, but it is a bad habit, so it would be better to change it. Subaru thought to himself with Beatrice's glum face beside him.

It is true that it was adorable, but apparently there was something in the current exchange that stuck in Beatrice's mind. Perhaps this face of Beatrice's is Roswaal-related.

Vincent: [So what else did you find out. Jumping out of the dragon carriage with such a big show, it's not an accomplishment if it's the same as staying on the dragon carriage.]

Beatrice: [It is Subaru, not Betty and the others, who made a big show of it, in fact. But, it is also Betty's duty to take responsibility for Subaru's big show, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [Of course, there were some fruits of our labor. Not so much about the characteristics of zombies, but I did learn a few thinnngs.]

Asked by Abel, Beatrice, and Roswaal responded confidently.

To the two of them, Subaru snapped his fingers and said, "As expected of you,"

Subaru: [So, so? You figured out the zombies' weaknesses? If we figured that out, we don’t have to be afraid of Sphinx when she appears again.]

Otto: [Natsuki-san, please do not get your hopes too high. No matter what, the results are…]

Beatrice: [You underestimate Betty and the others too much, in fact. It’s understood perfectly, I suppose.]

Otto: [Waah!?]

Subaru: [Seriously!?]

Subaru and Otto were astonished at Beatrice's words, with her chest puffed out and her face smug. Beatrice, pleased by their reaction, laughed and said, "Absolutely, in fact,"

Beatrice: [The hint was Garfiel's instincts, I suppose. Garfiel, who was already rampaging across the battlefield before Betty and the others, noticed something was wrong, in fact.]

Garfiel: [But if Beatrice ‘n the others hadn't come along, it might’ve slipped my mind.]

Roswaal: [I think it's a real shame that you're someone with excellent intuition, but you don't trust in it …Oh? I thought it was a compliment, as far as I'm concerned…]

Garfiel: [I'm not happy whether people praise me or criticize me.]

At Garfiel's rebuke, Roswaal closed one eye and shrugged, when Garfiel stuck out his tongue.

Aside from their usual bickering, Beatrice continued.

Beatrice: [The discrepancy Garfiel noticed was the difference in the durability of the zombies, I suppose. Some zombies would die from a single arrow, while others would still be alive and well even after ten arrows. That's the discrepancy, in fact.]

Emilia: [But isn't it because a zombee's strength is different? I am stronger than Subaru, so it could be that kind of difference.]

Beatrice: [That was not it, I suppose. The difference between Subaru and Anastasia is about the same, and the difference between one arrow and ten, in fact.]

Anastasia: [Ya can’t compare us to them; I feel sorry for Natsuki-kun, too.]

With a wry smile, Anastasia glanced at Subaru. However, since Subaru had been shrunk, he had no room to argue with her and responded to her concern with a wave of his hand.

However, Beatrice's mention of incongruity was certainly a concern. Also, Beatrice and Roswaal had revealed the truth behind that incongruity.

The answer was――,

Vincent: [Let us arrive at a conclusion. What caused the differences between the undead?]

Beatrice: [――A bug, I suppose.]

Vincent: [A bug…?]

When Abel's question was answered, Subaru furrowed his brow at the content of the answer.

Then, Beatrice looked at Roswaal and nodded. As if on cue, Roswaal took something out of his own pocket and said,

Roswaal: [Everyone, please be extremely careful. We have frozen it to stop its activity, but if the ice breaks, it is presumed that zombies will ariiiise~ here.]

Subaru: [What are you talking about… Hey, hey, hey, what's that!?]

Roswaal: [Beatrice said it, didn't she? It's a bug. I'd venture to call it a Corebug.]

In Roswaal's hand, as he had stated this, being pinched between his fingers was a small block of ice, about the size of a coin, with a red, round object within it.

Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a small round bug that looked like a caterpillar――.

Roswaal: [This Corebug is lurking within the body of every zombie. And this worm is the zombie's lifeblood… in other words, its very core.]

Subaru: [These bugs are their core, that means…]

Julius: [――I see. So, the true nature of Garfiel's perceived incongruity is the difference in the points at which arrow killed the Corebug within the zombie's body.]

Julius, however, was convinced, while Subaru was still surprised by the bug's impact.

Hearing Julius' words, the others also reached an understanding that they agreed on. Of course, Subaru also finally understood the purpose of the bugs' existence――,

Subaru: [So you're saying that the Corebug is the heart of a zombie?]

Roswaal: [We will be working to unravel the technique, but this Corebug acquires information about the target it makes into a zombie and recreates its original form by making a vessel out of earth… That is our conclusion.]

Beatrice: [Yes, in fact.]

Beatrice nodded her head in agreement with Roswaal's conclusion.

However, Subaru's mouth remained open at the conclusion that the two had reached.

To the extent that the zombies were being created by magic, could be accepted in a fantasy sense. However, when it came down to magical bugs creating zombies, the feeling of disgust prevailed.

Subaru: [I loved catching bugs when I was a kid, man, that's pathetic…]

Otto: [I do not think that is the kind of situation where you want that sort of reflection, though. ――In any case, the people here have made a difference. How do you like it, Your Excellency the Emperor?]

Vincent: [At the very least, you have proved that you are not an incompetent bunch who merely make big talk and produce no results. I shall admit that. It was a great service.]

Otto: […maybe it would be better if we don’t ask him anymore.]

Aside from the people of the Empire, it was a disreputable compliment to the people of the Kingdom, including Subaru.

Anyway, as Otto went out of his way to put it into words, even the eccentric Abel had to admit that Beatrice and the others had done a good job.

Inwardly, she must be grumbling, “Grrr”.

Subaru: [You did a great job; that's my Beako.]

Beatrice: [Naturally, I suppose. That is the real power of Subaru's partner, in fact. Unlike that deergirl, who has only gone through a little bit of hardship with Subaru, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Let's not be petty and get along with Tanza! Emilia-tan also said not to say anything nasty!]

After soothing Beatrice, who was showing her competitiveness in a strange way, Subaru then promised to pet her a hundred times to restore her good mood, and then looked at Abel and the others again.

When Abel returned the look, Subaru said, "Well?" with a puffed-out chest.

Subaru: [These are my trusted friends. All the big talk was worth it.]

Vincent: [I also recognize your achievement in preventing the earlier attack on the dragon carriage. Why must you be so proud of your victory over me? Your achievements are visible enough to the eye.]

Subaru: [Heh, whatever you say makes you sound like you're a sore loser. I'm feeling great right now.]

Subaru snorted pleasantly in response to Abel's displeased reply. Emilia was angry at him for this attitude, but Subaru could not disguise his true feelings.

Then, perhaps impatient with Subaru and his party's achievements, the leadership of the Empire ――Berstetz and Serena exchanged a few words, and then Abel looked over to them,

Berstetz: [Your Excellency, the people of the Kingdom… since our friend Margrave Mathers and his companions have shown so much success, would it not be a shame if we were unable to give a useful answer?]

Vincent: [High Countess Dracroy, why do you look so amused?]

Serena: [Amusing? Apologies, Your Excellency. I was not conscious of it myself, but perhaps it is a test of my dignity as Imperial nobility that I have to demonstrate the prestige of the Empire in order to save face.]

Vincent: [――――]

The white scar on Serena's face contorted as she replied, putting her hand on her own ample chest.

She was not smiling, but the tone of her voice and the intensity of her eyes were rather good-humored. In a situation that was not exactly in her favor, she had the mental strength that was extraordinary to be dealing with the emperor.

Subaru: [Maybe Serena-san is a pretty dangerous person?]

Garfiel: [I don't know if they're bad or not, but they're a friend of Roswaal's.]

Subaru: [Ahh~]

Seeking information about Serena, with whom he had little contact, the first bomb thrown in was enough to break down the wall of doubt.

However, it is hard to ask either Roswaal or Serena to choose their friends, since their cross-border friendship was probably a factor behind why Emilia and the others were able to come all the way to the empire to look for Subaru and the others.

Come to think of it, Roswaal was also very brazen during the Royal Selection.

It made sense to hear that he was friends with Serena, who held that attitude toward Abel.

Anastasia: [Now that I can talk about it, Natsuki-kun did the same back then, didn't he?]

Subaru: [I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you…]

Subaru covered his ears and ran away from his unpleasant past, but the warm eyes of the person looking at him gave the sermon, "You can't erase something bad from your past.".

And with the same lukewarm gaze turned to the gracious Emperor, Serena continued to persuade him.

Serena: [In any case, perhaps Your Excellency would find it useful. That is why a woman like me has an intuition that there is an aspect of keeping them by your side.]

Vincent: [Cease. No need to be so unscrupulous with your words, I understand.]

With a snort, Abel shielded Serena's gaze with his hand. Then he erased some of his pondering and revealed something prompted by Serena.

That was――,

Vincent: [――In confronting the Great Disaster, there is information that is worth discussing as to whether it is useful or not. We need to hear what they have to say before we arrive in the Fortified City.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [My ohhh~ my, are you finally going to listen to me? In that case, I’m overjoyed, Your Excellency.]

The person, said to be confined beyond the door of a firmly locked cabin within the dragon carriages, gave an amiable smile upon seeing Abel’s figure.

However, for him, in such a state of confinement, it really was not something that he should have been smiling at.

After all, his entire body was bound by chains, tied to a chair so as to never let him escape.

Subaru: [Oioi, Abel, no matter how you look at it, this is…]

Vincent: [A necessary measure. For better or worse, losing this man would be a major blow to our side. Allow me to warn you, if his restraints are removed, he will easily go off to his death.]

???: [It’s outraaaageous~ that I’d go off to die! It’s just that I've been doing everything I can to stop this Great Disaster until now… If it’s for that purpose, it doesn’t matter if I lose my life.]

Subaru: [Ohh…]

Thoughtlessly smiling, the delicate man rocked back and forth in the chair he was bound to.

Feeling a sense of insanity from that manner of speaking, even Subaru could not help but believe that Abel’s argument was no exaggeration. 

However, even though they seemed to be nothing but suspicious――,

Subaru: [This, Stargazer is… Ubilk-san, was it? You said we could rely on this person?]

Ubilk: [Whaaat’s~ this, it’s upsetting that I’m being doubted… Wait, taking a closer look, aren’t you the Stargazer-san of the Kingdom that I paaassed~ by in Chaosflame!?]

Subaru: [You’re completely wrong. Ah! By any chance, were you the one who instilled the idea that I’m a Stargazer into this guy’s head!? I ended up in a fist-fight with him because of that!]

The delicate man with a sparkling face―― Ubilk, had uttered a rash remark that caused Subaru to snap back.

For Subaru, being treated like he had the dubious occupation of a Stargazer was a huge inconvenience. Of course, since Stargazers took on some sort of prophet-like role, Subaru understood there was a risk that he, who could Return by Death, could appear to be like them; but even so, it was a huge inconvenience.

At any rate――,

Subaru: [I’m not the same as you. Keep that in mind.]

Ubilk: [Ehhhh~? That sure is strange. I heard that you were the same, though…]

Subaru: [Was that from the stars? In that case, Abel, we aren’t gonna be able to rely on this person.]

If it turned out that the stars gave incorrect answers, they were something he would unfortunately want to avoid right now.

At the present moment, the important thing was to acquire accurate information from the stars, no matter how trivial. Vague prophecies that could be taken either way, along the lines of the Barnum effect, were unnecessary.

Hence, he promptly turned his back in disappointment, but――,

Ubilk: [Wait wait, please waaait~! Understoooood~! You areeeen’t~ a Stargazer! That doesn’t matter to me!]

Subaru: [I’m bothered by your manner of speaking, but even if you amend your statement it’s not like your credibility is suddenly restored…]

Ubilk: [I don’t care if you keeeep~ me locked up like this. But, please at least listen to what I’ve gazed from the stars. That’s all you need to do!]

Subaru: [――――]

Twisting around in his seat with a burst of strength, Ubilk appealed so, his eyes ablaze. With such vigor, the chains wrapped around him forcefully tore into his skin, to the extent that his blood mercilessly spilled out.

Completely ignoring the pain, he was trying to convey some information he had heard from the stars as a Stargazer. If he could do that, injuries would not matter to him.

It seemed as if even his own life did not matter to him.

Subaru: [Abel, these Stargazer people are…]

Vincent: [Do away with that sentiment. Hear what he must say, and then decide whether it is worth consideration.]

That intense fixation towards the stars gave Subaru an unpleasant sense of deja vu. But, Abel did not agree with that judgment of Subaru’s, and proactively fixed his gaze on Ubilk.

Seeing Abel’s willingness to listen, Ubilk ceased his writhing, his gentle face forming a smile.

Ubilk: [Rest assured, Your Excellency. No matter how mighty the Great Disaster may be, the staaaars~ are on the side of Your Excellency.]

Vincent: [The same cruel stars that make no distinction as to which Vincent Vollachia is left behind, hm? Do not make me laugh. ――Speak. What must you convey?]

Ubilk: [Two, there are.]

Abel posed the question with arms crossed, and Ubilk gave that short reply.

Hearing it, Subaru muttered “two” inside his mouth, and Abel urged him to continue through silence.

Subaru was extremely apprehensive as to whether they could put their trust in him, but at the very least, the Stargazer was said to have predicted the arrival of the Great Disaster itself; right now, information would be given for the sake of the Empire as it shook.

That was――,

Ubilk: [Two lights, to overturn the peril of the Great Disaster. The first, brought by a Stargazer of the Kingdom… or rather, by the boy who is not that, is a girl unable to communicate with words.]

Subaru: [...What?]

Ubilk glanced towards Subaru, and the latter widened his eyes, motionless at the words that had followed.

He had been questioning whether to fully believe Ubilk’s words or not, but the words that had followed made it unthinkable that there was any cause to believe him. 

After all, there was only one person who met the conditions that Ubilk had just spoken of.

Then, without sparing a moment for him to recover from that impact, Ubilk continued.

With the same lips that had revealed one of the so-called two lights, he continued to the light which yet remained.

That light, it was――,

Ubilk: [――The most well-versed in curses across all the Empire, the beastman who stands atop one of the nine summits.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Kicking off the ground, out of breath, he ran up the rocky mountain path through sheer force.

???: [Fuck fuck fucking fuck, these fucking shithead bastards…!]

Even the vigor in his words had grown weak; he was aware that he was wearing himself out.

Running across plains, and continuing to fight without sleep or rest, were things he had always been doing in order to survive in the vast lands of the Empire since he was a child.

Nevertheless, the stress from going over ten days without eating or drinking was a different dimension entirely.

???: [――Hk]

Sniff; when the stench of earth mixed in with something strange entered his nasal cavity, he furiously began to exert his limbs.

Neither did he try to catch a glimpse with his eyes, nor try to listen with his ears. He was able to fully grasp the world through what his nose could smell alone. Even the positions, numbers, and general armaments of his enemies.

Because of that, he understood that he was surrounded by a hundred enemy troops, that it would be hopeless no matter how much he whittled down their numbers; it made him want to think that his nose had gone stupid.

???: [These, FUCKING ASSHOLES!]

But, he immediately dispelled those thoughts, and slammed his weapon into the scent of earth.

A first, a second, and third; the bodies of the enemies that received a direct hit were blown to pieces, and the impact perforated through to the opponents on the other side, allowing him to forcefully break through the encirclement and get away.

No matter how many he took down, the pale earth dolls ceaselessly sprang forth.

Those nightmarish things of poor craftsmanship were undoubtedly prowling after his life.

The army unit he commanded was annihilated, and it was already all too late when he realized; while doubting his talents as a General, he continued to run east, and further east, clinging to his dear life.

Even if he tried to converge somewhere, the paths continued to be obstructed; and not only was he starved and thirsty, but his last contact with a living person had been when he parted with his second-in-command.

At the very least, it would be nice if a few of his subordinates had been able to survive.

???: [Tch――!!]

The moment his thoughts veered off topic, his reaction to the enemy slashing at him had been slow.

His shoulder plate protected against the attack as it grazed his shoulder, and taking the opportunity to escape the impact, he kicked off the surface of the mountain trail. Compared to proceeding up the narrow path filled with those hindrances, slipping off the side of the cliff was much better.

Deciding that, he ran down the cliff which was as steep as a right angle, and began to shake off the pursuing enemies quicker.

Even if he was going to be cornered by the amount of enemies being thrown at him, a small breather would be somewhat helpful.

Having faith in that, he ran, ran, and ran――,

???: [――Hk, this smell is…]

Mixed among the earth, vegetation, and slight fragrance of flowers, the smell of life tickled his nasal cavity.

Sensing something that was different to the scent of iron from the weapons his pursuers held, his thoughts were scattered into a thousand pieces for a moment, but he immediately consulted the situation and followed the smell of life.

He hesitated about dragging other people into his fight with this enemy.

However, if he were to avoid that, he would suffer from hunger and thirst and lose all his strength. That would be the stupidest, most idiotic fucking conclusion he could reach.

???: [...Fuck, a hidden village?]

Following the smell of life, he entered an isolated settlement among the mountains.

In the Empire, there were a considerable number of people who abandon their land in order to evade taxation, and either become bandits or go to live in the mountains or forest. This settlement was probably one of those hidden villages.

As a General of the Empire, he typically would not let the existence of this hidden village slide, but――,

???: [It’s a fucking emergency! It’s fine for now! More importantly…]

Wondering if anyone was present, he gazed over the whole settlement, and sniffed his nose when nobody entered his vision.

The origin of the smell of life was this settlement, but what potently ticked his nasal cavity was not a lingering scent, but the stench of somebody who was currently present here.

He headed in that direction, and if they were someone who could fight, he would request their assistance.

Even if they could buy him a little time, he would probably be able to use it to regain his physical strength through a meal and water.

Rousing his heart right before he was about to wither and die, he relied on the scent and went towards a large building in the settlement.

He approached the entrance, and burst inside.

???: [Oi! I dunno who you are, but would you lend me a hand against these fucking bastards――]

――That instant, he was met with two columns of wind as they violently flashed.

???: [FUCKING CLOSE ONE!!]

Right away, he leaned his head and hips back in order to evade, and was late in sensing that what had been unleashed were sharp slashing attacks.

He had barged in requesting help, but instead an attempt had been made to kill hiim; he snarled his fangs, and intently glared at the opponent who had performed such a foolish fucking action.

And then――,

???: [Oh? Now this is quite the strange happening! To think we’d try and see whether the next dead person’d be a man or a woman, only for a living person to plunge in… Redhead! Looks like I’m the winner of our bet!]

???: [Shut the fuck up, be quiet, die. Winning, losing, it’s all fucking worthless…]

As he glared, what had entered his vision was the inside of a spacious building, where two middle-aged men sat by a round table―― Furthermore, they were men who absolutely reeked of liquor. 

One held a katana, and the other a knight sword; while looking at the drunken state of the two, anger surged up within him, and for a moment, it caused him to forget about his empty stomach and parched throat――,

???: [Hey motherfuckers, these perilous days of the Empire aren’t the time for you to be getting fucking shitfaced drunk, FUCKING HELL!!]

With that, the Master of Curse Tools, Groovy Gumlet, exclaimed in a terribly straightforward manner.
