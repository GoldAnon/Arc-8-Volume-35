*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

The battle began undeniably with a salvo from the impatient Roswaal.

Roswaal: [――Will you please die.]

And then, in contrast to those cold words, a scorching fire exploded as if it to burn up the sky.

The flames raged and spread across the night sky all at once. The burning sky caught the eyes of everyone, even the warriors who were still fighting for their lives against the Undead.

Even though the goal was just to burn down one enemy, this seemed like overkill.

Beatrice: [Barbaric, like burning down a mansion to kill the winged insects in one's room, I suppose.

目的のために屋敷を燃やすなんて、PetraとOttoしかやらない暴挙だ。
Burning down a mansion on purpose was an outrage that only Petra and Otto would do.

Beatrice was secretly grateful that she had the courage to leave the Forbidden Library without that kind of boldness, but she still thought it was too much.

Roswaal demonstrated the same overkill as those two with his first strike.

However――,

Sphinx: [Threat level recognized. Correction: Required]

After flipping herself in the air to escape from the burning night sky, the enemy ――Sphinx was alive and well.

Even if you go through the trouble of burning down the mansion, it is meaningless if the crucial winged insects escape. In this case, Roswaal just burned the sky and surprised everyone around him.

Imagine if Roswaal was the only one here.

Beatrice: [El Minya.]

Sphinx, with her pink hair ruffled, flew freely through the sky, and the blink of purple light that emerged on her path was the pinnacle of magic that made time stand still for its target, and shattered it.

It was a deadly attack that had already been verified to have the best effect against the undead.

Beatrice: [It is not good that no one except Subaru and Betty have mastered Yin magic, in fact.]

Even against an army of undead, there would be nothing to fear with a full force of users of Yin magic.

Even Beatrice, who has lived such a long time, had never witnessed a scene where more than ten users of Yin magic were all in one place, so she knew it would be an impossible proposition.

With such unhelpful thoughts, Beatrice preemptively dismissed the hesitation within her.

――To strike down the loathsome "enemy" who shares the same face as Ryuzu Meyer.

Beatrice: [Ryuzu…]

Ryuzu Meyer's fleeting smile passed through Beatrice's mind.

Unlike the Ryuzu's, who Garfiel and Frederica consider their grandmother, Ryuzu Meyer, their progenitor, was Beatrice's first lifelong friend.

At the time, she could not admit it. But, now it was too late.

However, now it is different. Now, Beatrice can properly accept the magnitude of her presence. That's why this "enemy" is to Beatrice――,

Beatrice: [Things have come to a head, I suppose!]

Sphinx plunged headlong into howling Beatrice's view and into the purple arrows that were about to be released.

The "enemy's" eyes narrowed briefly as she raised her hands in front of her face, and white light shot out from her five fingers on either side, cutting off all the Minya that were standing in her way.

The purple crystals were blown to pieces without even a shattering sound ―― but Beatrice's frustration could not be broken with that much.

Sphinx: [――Hk.]

Although Sphinx had supposedly dismissed the threat, her expression was slightly distorted.

The cause was that the purple crystals, which she should have cut away, spread as flying debris while in their shattered state and chased after the fast-flying Sphinx.

Beatrice: [Magic is an idea, and as soon as you think you've stopped it, it go all wrong, in fact.]

However, the shape of the crystalline arrow Minya represents is not what is important. It is about the effect of freezing and shattering the time of the person it strikes.

No matter what shape or size it is, as long as it pierces the opponent, even when it is not in the shape of an arrow.

So Beatrice's flying debris, ignited with a competitive spirit, would not let Sphinx escape.

And――,

Sphinx: [Threat level recognized. Once more, correction: req――]

Garfiel: [――Yer a hundred years too late to rethink this.]

Sphinx, who was evading the flying Minya that would turn her to stone, and was fervently trying to escape, was lined up right next to the evil countenance of Garfiel, who had leapt off the ground with a kick.

Eyes sharp and fangs bared, Garfiel snarled like a ferocious beast, swinging his lithe arms with a mighty swing, attempting to hit the Sphinx with all his might.

For a moment, Garfiel's and Sphinx's gazes met.

Garfiel's hesitation to strike his fist into an opponent with the same face as that of his grandmother made his heart――,

Garfiel: [Compared to granny, yer heart smells different――!!]

Such outfield concerns were unnecessary for the dependable military officer in Emilia's camp.

A fist launched, catching Sphinx in the side, shooting the girl's body out of the air and into the ground, and continued pressing against her on the ground with tremendous force.

There was a thunderous roar, and a cloud of dust rose as if a large rock had fallen, and Beatrice could see Sphinx's body flutter like a leaf on the other side of his swinging arm.

Garfiel's shot was one of pure fury, without mercy or hesitation.

With a direct hit, even one shot would likely reduce Beatrice to mana; Sphinx was blown away as she rolled behind the plume.

Roswaal: [It’s a three-person hunting corral. That was nice teamwork, waaasn’t it?]

Beatrice: [Says the guy who usually loses his temper first, I suppose.]

Garfiel: [Teamwork with ya is disgustin’.]

In response to Beatrice’s and Garfiel’s abusive language, Roswaal shrugged his shoulders, as if to say that he was completely unperturbed.

Pushed away like that, Roswaal shrugged again.

And then――,

Sphinx: […Once more, threat level recognized. Correction: required.]

Sphinx muttered as she slowly moved her body on the ground as the dust began to settle.

Collapsed on the ground and coated in dirt, Sphinx did not show any expression of pain, but there was a clear accumulation of damage in the sound of her voice.

Everyone: [――――]

Still, she stared at Beatrice and the other two with glowing golden eyes.

They were not filled with feelings of hostility or anger, but rather a mysterious look of intelligence that was only interested in them.

Garfiel: [Damn, this ain’t to my liking.]

Like Beatrice, Garfiel felt a chill go down his spine at the gaze of his enemy and clicked his tongue. Roswaal squinted in silence as well, and began to knead mana within himself in obvious discomfort.

Once again, Roswaal gave a sidelong glance to avoid acting early as Beatrice glared at Sphinx as she stood up, then immediately moved forward.

Trying to find out her true intentions, as typical of the unreliable pair――,

Beatrice: [Sphinx, why were you summoned, in fact? What are you thinking――]

Like that, Beatrice questioned her.

Sphinx: [――――]

Sphinx stood up on the spot, her body trembling, as her gaze fell on her own chest.

The tip of a blade protruded from Sphinx's small chest. It was the deadly blade that had stabbed her in the back and jutted out of her chest.

And the one who was holding the blade was――,

Mizelda: [I have a bad feeling about this girl. I don't see any reason to keep her alive.]

Mizelda, who had stated so in a bleak manner, pulled out the dagger that had stabbed her again and again.

After three concentrated stabs to the back and chest, she grabbed Sphinx by the hair and forced her head upward, then mercilessly slit her neck with a dagger held in a backhand grip.

It was the body of an undead. No blood was spilled, but there was no doubt that all of it was lethal.

Sphinx's body also fell forward onto her knees in a heap on the spot.

Beatrice: [You, you, you… Hk.]

Beatrice was at a loss for words as she stared wide-eyed at Mizelda, who was standing beside the fallen Sphinx, making sure no blood had gotten on her knife.

Roswaal and Garfiel were also left speechless at Mizelda's actions.

Mizelda tilted her beautiful, strong-eyed head at the scene of the three of them,

Mizelda: [I know that she had a history with you guys. But, talk to her grave. That's the battlefield custom.]

Garfiel: [Well, I guess that's true…]

It was a blunt outlook, but Garfiel resigned himself to the fact that it was irrefutable.

Beatrice has been frequently surprised by the human values in Vollachia, but she has changed her perception of their seriousness, believing that it was still naivete.

Roswaal: [Sphinx.]

Roswaal, ignoring Beatrice's and Garfiel's agitation, stepped forward. He looked down at the fallen Sphinx and called out her name in a sidelong glance that showed little emotion.

Mizelda's blow, a fatal one, was evident not only in the location of the wounds, but also in the way Sphinx's body crumbled.

Most of her lower body had already turned to dust, and the girl's face, which had been cracked from the start, was beginning to peel away, and it would only be a matter of time before the whole thing was reduced to pieces.

However, the undead Sphinx's life force had not been exhausted yet.

She had no power to counterattack or struggle, but she had enough energy to move her golden eyes and look back toward Roswaal, who was looking down at her.

Roswaal: [――――]

It was still painful to see Ryuzu's figure crumble, even though he knew he was a different person inside.

What Roswaal was feeling was probably different from Beatrice's sentimentality, but Mizelda's stark realism prevented it, and perhaps deprived her of an outlet for that sentimentality.

In any case, the source of the suffering of Beatrice and the other three was――,

Sphinx: […Additional deliberation: Required.]

In the midst of her crumbling body, one could hear Sphinx mumbling, never showing any of the pain on her face.

At first, Beatrice thought it was a statement of regret for her shortcomings.

Sphinx: [――You.]

However, the word that followed indicated otherwise.

Beatrice gasped at the added word, and Garfiel groaned, "Huh?"

Beatrice, as well, was not quite sure of the true meaning of this. But she could sense that it was not a throwaway line that could be ignored.

It was――,

Roswaal: [――Damn it!]

Roswaal looked up as if he had been played.

He had a look of frustration and remorse on his face, and turned around toward the rear. ――Back behind, he flew through the sky with Beatrice, towards the coupled dragon carriage that drove ahead of him.

Likewise, Beatrice turned to Roswaal's frustration.

Then, struck by the turmoil in her own small chest,

"――Subaru," she called his name.

△▼△▼△▼△

An instant, yes, everything happened in an instant.

Immediately after he had noticed the strange sight and vocalized it, everything was swallowed up by a white light.

Emilia, who was by his side, Rem, and even Julius, none of them were given a chance to react. Naturally, Subaru also could do nothing as the white light swallowed everything up and vanished.

Natsuki Subaru immediately intuited what that meant.

——That his life had been taken, and Return by Death had begun.

As proof of that—

???: [――I love you.]

Is what he heard her whisper, as if she, having found him once, would never let him go again.

Rem: [Um, would you mind it if I asked you to take care of some of my confusion first?]

The moment he heard that voice, filled with equal parts astonishment and exhaustion along with a tinge of irritation, the "Ready, Go!" switch in Subaru was pushed.

Subaru: [――――]

He confirmed his footing and the situation around him, understanding the specific moment from the faces present. 

It was the aisle of the coupled dragon carriage, the scene where Rem had joined in on the conversation he was having with Emilia and Julius. From the flow of the conversation, Subaru's last remark was “And, it's possible that Priscilla may have told her something she didn't necessarily want to hear in Guaral…”, which was made in consideration of Rem's situation. Towards the front of the dragon carriage, Abel, Otto and the others were in charge of understanding the details regarding combat potential, meanwhile, far behind the running carriage, Beatrice, who had been sent off with Roswaal in order to explore ways to counter the undead from a magical perspective, would have been approaching their destination. The two were headed to the place where Garfiel and People of Shudraq were engaged in fierce battle, the members of the Pleiades Battalion should be there as well, and with a feeling akin to a prayer that no one would get seriously injured, and the trust that since it’s them, they will be fine, his heart was tumultuous.    

--Subaru, having switched on, whittled down everything up to that point in an instant.

Emilia: [Subaru?]

In a surprised voice, Emilia called out Subaru's name. For a moment, her eyes must have caught the rapid movement of Subaru’s eyes darting round and round.

Once before, having seen Subaru in the same state, Tanza had also pointed it out.

Tanza: [Schwartz-sama’s eyes were shifting to and fro, it was, um, eerie.]

That was Tanza's comment, choosing her words carefully and yet unable to find the right ones, about Subaru's unusual behavior as he tried to grasp the situation immediately after Returning by Death.

Emilia's reaction to seeing the same thing being much more modest was understandable. 

Anyway——,

Subaru: [Emilia, just wait a little]

Raising his hand to avoid being questioned, Subaru's awareness was sharpened to a knife’s edge.

In an environment where dying and retrying is a given, the senses that were essential to ensure the survival of everyone on Gladiator Island wrapped Subaru, and in order to investigate the cause that brought about his Death, his concentration was exerted to the limit. 

This was not the time to be fussing over sluggish thoughts like “Did I just die?”.  

If he had died, then without the sensation of having caught up with that fact, a solution cannot be arrived at. 

It was necessary to understand that the inability to make that switch quickly could cause Subaru and those around him to lose their lives twice as many times.

Rem: [――?  Um…]

Emilia: [Rem, please.]

Next to Subaru, who was concentrating, Rem with her eyebrows slightly knitted looked at him with questioning eyes. But Emilia stopped her from questioning with her hand and held her back.

Meanwhile, Subaru had finished correlating his Death with the events just prior to Returning by Death――,

Subaru: [――――]

Outside the window of the running coupled dragon carriage, he once again caught sight of the out-of-place object blending into the landscape.

Instantly, Subaru jumped toward the window of the dragon carriage and,

Subaru: [――Julius! Outside!]

Julius: [Understood.]

Emilia and Rem felt the change in Subaru, and naturally, Julius did too.

The fact that he moved without a moment's hesitation immediately upon Subaru's call is proof of that. Julius drew his knight sword behind Subaru, who had jumped toward the window, and slashed the wall of the aisle with a diagonal swipe, and stretching his long leg from behind, kicked the wall down.

Then, with Subaru under his arm, he leaped out of the effect of the "Divine Protection of Wind Evasion" from the multiple earth dragons.

Julius: [Leave the landing to me!]

Subaru: [I leave it to you.]

The moment they were out of Divine Protection's range, fierce winds and inertia battered Subaru and Julius. But Subaru handed over all the preparations for survival to Julius, who took it on himself.

Softly, a yellow and green Quasi Spirit emerged around Julius, with one turning into a carpet of wind and the other into a cushion of earth to support their landing.

However, Subaru's attention was not drawn to Julius' masterful technique, woven together by his renewed bond with his Quasi Spirits.

Even when the window he had jumped through was cut off from the wall, and when he landed in the flowing wind storm that followed, his gaze remained fixed on a single point ――the girl who fell from the sky.

Subaru: [I knew it, identical to Ryuzu-san...]

With her pink hair and black robes, she is identical to the lovely and Baba-like Ryuzu. However, no matter how much Emilia and the others were worried about Subaru and Rem, they would not drag Ryuzu to the Vollachian Empire.

In other words, they could not be the real Ryuzu, nor could they be any of the Picos, all of whom are copies in the same form as Ryuzu.

To make them distinguishable, they all have different hairstyles and individual ribbons and hair ornaments. The fact that none of them are any of those things means that they could not be any of them.

Subaru: [Julius! Hold that girl down!]

Subaru shouted, pointing to the fake Ryuzu in the air, before it had even landed on the ground.

Hearing Subaru's request, Julius also spotted the girl blending into the night sky. Leaving all questions about who or what she is behind, the "Finest" jumped into action.

Dropping Subaru on the soft soil beneath his feet, Julius' body was enveloped in the remnants of the carpet of wind, using it as a foothold to leap through the air and approach in a straight line toward the fake Ryuzu.

The fake Ryuzu recognized Julius as a threat because of his fearsome intensity.

Instantly, he realized that the eyes of the fake Ryuzu had a brilliant golden glow even at night, and understood that she was a pale-skinned undead, something he had not been able to recognize from a distance.

Without any delay, the fake Ryuzu turned her hand to Julius, and the abominable white light was about to be released to Julius, and――,

Julius: [――In, Ness, lend me your strength.]

The light coming from fake Ryuzu's fingertips, a different white light, made Julius' whole body faintly glow, and in turn, a black light thinly enveloped fake Ryuzu's whole body.

The moment it became clear that it was the simultaneous application of both Yin and Yang magic by the two Quasi Spirits, Julius' knightly sword flashed, and the strength drained from the fake Ryuzu's light-infused arm.

Sphinx: [Explanation: Required.]

Julius: [I cut the tendon in your shoulder. Of course, it will likely reconnect soon...]

Julius dutifully replied to the fake Ryuzu, who asked the reason for the lack of strength in her arm. At the end of his answer, Julius twists in mid-air, and his long, howling leg struck the girl in mid-air, knocking her body to the ground.

At the point where the fake Ryuzu fell, the ground transformed with a yellow light. The ground, which had become viscous, softly and deeply took in the girl's body, and then hardened all at once.

As a result, the fake Ryuzu was stuck as if wrapped in a blanket made of stone.

Julius: [I do not recommend you resist. If you do not heed this advice, I will treat you as an enemy, living or dead.]

Sphinx: [――――]

Julius, his sword, pointed at the fake Ryuzu lying on her back on the ground.

Having thus incapacitated his opponent, Julius nodded to Subaru, who had witnessed it. Subaru, who had no choice but to watch the sequence of events, scratched his cheek with his finger,

Subaru: [No, that's what I wanted you to do… Seriously, this guy. Clearly, you're a lot stronger than you were before.]

The combination of Quasi Spirit's support in fighting is more sophisticated and refined than before.

A Spirit Knight, contracted with six different types of Quasi Spirits, showed off his hybrid fighting style, combining magic and swordsmanship.

Subaru: [Wow, amazing, you took her down so fast.]

And from behind Subaru, running on the grass, was Emilia.

She apparently jumped off the dragon carriage in pursuit of Subaru and Julius, her eyes widened when she saw that she had no chance to stand in the way of Julius' brilliant handiwork.

Subaru: [Emilia-tan, what about Rem?]

Emilia: [I asked Otto-kun and the others to tell everyone that you and Julius jumped off the roof. I needed to hurry, too, so I followed you right away.]

Subaru: [No, it's not that your too slow, Emilia-tan. It's that this guy is too fast. Also, it's a good thing you didn't bring Rem here.]

It seemed possible that Rem might come down with them, but thanks to Emilia's good judgment, she would not be involved in any danger.

Even when he thought about it, he reconsidered that even Rem, when she had her memories, was going to jump off at all, so Emilia was very correct when she instructed her to stay anyway.

In any case――,

Emilia: [That’s not Ryuzu-san, right?]

Subaru: [She looks exactly like her, but I'm pretty sure she’s a <u>zombie</u>. Come to think of it, can someone like Beako or Ryuzu-san become <u>zombies</u>...?]

He didn't even want to think about Beatrice or Ryuzu dying, but it was open to question whether zombification was possible for these women, whose physical make-up was different from that of normal creatures.

In fact, since there was an undead that looked like Ryuzu, her origins must be the same as Ryuzu's unless she was a miraculous look-alike.

Then, wishing to conduct an interview without any unnecessary thoughts, Subaru and Emilia headed over to the fake Ryuzu, who had been captured by Julius.

Emilia: [She’s a zombie that can talk and think. Subaru, be careful.]

Subaru: [Yeah. Actually, she’s probably more dangerous than she looks. Emilia-tan, could you also be careful?]

Emilia: [Yeah, I got it. If you behave, umm…]

Emilia, who had been entrusted to be vigilant, was puzzled by what to say to the fake Ryuzu.

It was doubtful that the warning, "If you don't resist, we won't hurt you," was meaningful against an undead. Nevertheless, they must never let their guard down.

This small existence just wiped out the coupled dragon carriage holding Subaru and the others in a single breath.

Even if her limbs were held fast, it was uncertain whether she was perfectly immobilized.

Subaru: [That’s a shame that your preemptive strike failed.]

Sphinx: [――. You are…]

Subaru: [My name is…I wanted to give my name on reflex, but I’m not trying to be friends with you. I’ll just say that you’re a dangerous person and I’m the one who blocked your plans.]

Sphinx: [Understood, you are a strangely capable person. At first glance, you seem to have no outstanding ability.]

Fake Ryuzu, lying down and looking up at Subaru, made such observations.

He was used to being underestimated, so he was not upset with that assessment. Beside him, Emilia wanted to say something, but Julius shook his head to stop her.

In any event――,

Subaru: [No other zombies came. Was one person ahead of the others because she could fly? If you thought you could beat us and rushed ahead, that’s too bad.]

In fact, he had already been killed once in a preemptive attack, but he did not show it.

It would be beneficial if this provocation would make the opponent open up. However, it seemed that she was not so thin-skinned as he had hoped, and there was no emotional response.
 
However, it would be promising if this was the type of person that would be tempted to show off their intelligence by making misguided and repetitive statements.

If necessary, Subaru is ready to play the role of a stupid child of a lifetime with all his might.

However――

Sphinx: [――Valga Cromwell.]

Subaru: [Huh?]

Suddenly, the lips of the girl lying there uttered unfamiliar words.

――No, it sounded familiar, but Subaru could not immediately recall when it was and what it was about.

While Subaru furrowed his brow at the question, Emilia and Julius reacted differently.

Both of them reacted as if they knew the name.

But before Emilia or the others could say a word in response to the fake Ryuzu's words――,

Sphinx: [This was their plan that was not implemented at the time.]

Yes, it was the fake Ryuzu who was quicker to continue.

What followed also connected seamlessly by ignoring the delayed question that was asked.

Emilia: [Subaru!]

A moment later, Subaru heard Emilia's facial expression change, and he was forcefully pulled into her arms. As it was, Emilia gnashed her molars, and a wall of ice was created around Subaru and the others.

Inside the wall of ice, Julius also readied his knight's sword, which had been aimed at the fake Ryuzu at his feet, and clothed himself in the rainbow light of the combined power of the six Quasi Spirits.

In response to something critical to come, Emilia and Julius have completed their preparations for the moment.

And that was――,

Subaru: [――Wha.]

――A white light streaked down from beyond the sky and erased them all at once, as if in a cruel mockery.

△▼△▼△▼△

Rem: [Um, would you mind it if I asked you to take care of some of my confusion first?]

Subaru: [――Hk]

The voice of Rem, filled equally with bewilderment, exhaustion, and irritation, was heard, causing Subaru to draw a short breath.

Unlike the last time, the remorse at being unable to avert the arrival of the Death he knew was coming, and the trembling of his soul that was struck by the shock he had anticipated, battered Subaru's heart from within.

――He had completely misjudged the cause of his Death.

It was the result of latching on to the most obvious visible change and the conceit that it had been prevented.

The first time, the gap between noticing the existence of the fake Ryuzu and Death was too short, causing him to overlook the actual event. 

The absurdly powerful white light that obliterated Subaru and the others was not released by the fake Ryuzu, but had originated from somewhere else.

Emilia: [Subaru?]

Subaru: [——. Emilia, just wait a little]

Noticing Subaru's introspection, Emilia tilted her head, to which he raised a hand in response.

Pausing his reflection, he cast aside his regret. While there is room for growth in reflection, regret is just self-pity over not doing what should have been done. 

With that, neither the self he had pitied, nor the others he had neglected, not a single person could be saved.

That, he will not allow. That, he absolutely, will not allow. 

At that moment, fake Ryuzu had mentioned the name Valga Cromwell. It still did not ring a bell for Subaru, but Emilia and Julius seemed to know. He wondered if he should ask for more details. ――No, that could wait. Even if he found out who this Valga was, the power of the white light that followed would not just disappear. That attack was real, and more so, an outrageously potent threat that stood in the way of Subaru and the others. It must be dealt with, was it possible to prevent it from being launched? The situation with the fake Ryuzu and the attack could not possibly be unrelated, but would she, an undead being, be willing to negotiate in the first place? If it’s an undead that could communicate, would it not be dangerous to close off the window of negotiation? No, if they could be reasoned with, then they would not have tried to kill without question. Whether they could be reasoned with or not, In order to get to the negotiating table the table needs to be set――.

Rem: [――?  Um…]

Emilia: [Rem, please.]

Beside Subaru whose thoughts were in full throttle, Emilia held back Rem's doubt.

The flow of events was the same as before, but from this point on, it had to be steered toward a different development. Within his mind, he put everything that had happened in order. To get off the railtrack that ended in Death, a change must be made at the critical juncture.    

For that reason――,

Subaru: [――Julius! Outside! Emilia, come too!]

Julius: [Understood.]

Emilia: [Yes! Got it!]

The moment he glimpsed the appearance of the little girl, the harbinger of the Death that would soon arrive, he jumped towards the window and called out to Emilia and Julius behind him.  

Without hesitation, Julius’s sword strike sliced through the wall of the coupled dragon carriage, and once the wall was kicked down, Subaru and the others moved outside. Just before they escaped the range of the Divine Protection of WInd Evasion, he yelled.

Subaru: [――Rem! I need a favor!] 

△▼△▼△▼△

A long leg flashed, a kick knocked the false Ryuzu to the ground, the changing nature of the earth caught the body of the wight, and once again, the earthen bedding restrained its entire body.

Julius: [Resistance is not advised. If you do not heed this advice, regardless of whether you are living or dead, I will consider you an «enemy».]

Sphinx: [――]

As she lies on the ground, the fake Ryuzu stares at Julius, who points his sword at her, perhaps marveling at Julius's fluent moves, despite the fact that he has no advantage from Subaru's "Return by Death" in the way he fights.

To Julius, who had dominated his opponent with his pure ability, Subaru clenched his fist.

Subaru: [Not Ryuzu-san, right?]

In a split second, Julius neutralized his opponent, with the false Ryuzu at his feet, and Emilia, who jumped down from the dragon carriage at the same time, furrowed her shapely eyebrows.

Subaru also does not know the true identity of the fake Ryuzu. Only that she is a zombie and that she is capable and willing to do harm to Subaru and the others.

Subaru: [They look alike, but they are neither Ryuzu-san nor Pico and his friends. Rather, put me down and be on the lookout! Be prepared, Emilia!]

Emilia: [Be careful? Even though that girl has already been taken care of by Julius?]

Subaru: [More heavy hitters are coming. If you're not prepared, even you'll get killed.]

Saying that, Subaru held in Emilia's arms jumped down.

This time, Emilia was left to cover the landing, and Julius was asked to immediately detain the fake Ryuzu. With that, Subaru nodded to the surprised Emilia and rushed toward Julius, who subdued the fake Ryuzu,

Subaru: [Good job! But there's more! There is going to be a huge shot from out of the sky! If we don't stop it, we're all in trouble!]

Julius: [From the sky?]

Subaru: [Emilia is taking a deep breath, too!]

Skipping over minor details, Subaru points to Emilia in the back.

Beyond that, with her arms spread wide, Emilia was taking slow, long, deep breaths. Her concentration is improving in preparation for what's to come.

To which Julius nodded his head, and the six-colored Quasi Spirits gathered around him.

Julius: [――. Indeed you]

Quickly, both Emilia and Julius hurry their preparations, and the fake Ryuzu, who is restrained to the ground, gazes at Subaru with skepticism.

With the current exchange, she would have quickly understood that the cause of her head being pinned down was Subaru's toils. But the surprise of the fake Ryuzu did not end there.

Subaru: [Valga Cromwell]

"----"
Sphinx: [――――]

Subaru: [That's your Chief of Operation’s name, isn't it?]

Closing one eye, Subaru makes the fake Ryuzu understand that he will be able to see her intentions.

In truth, neither the intentions of the fake Ryuzu nor even the identity of Valga Cromwell are known, but it is a bluffing technique that does not reveal that fact.

The information came from the fake Ryuzu herself, and it astonished the fake Ryuzu.

In fact, the previously unchanged expression on the fake Ryuzu's cheeks stiffened, and a stronger gaze than before was directed at Subaru.

Sphinx: [Caution towards that Magician and the Spirit Knight was of note, but attention should also be paid to you.]

Subaru: [...Your plan has been seen through. You can throw in the towel gracefully]

“It's okay," Subaru tried to continue his bluff. However, a bluff could not affect the spirit of the Fake Ryuzu, and she had a different plan in the first place.

The fake Ryuzu's scheme is not the kind of thing that can be discerned and will fail.

Sphinx: [Valga's strategy is one that can be detected but not prevented]

At that moment, that white light from beyond the sky was aiming at Subaru and his friends―― no, it wasn't.

The white light was not aimed at Subaru and his friends, it was aimed at the fake Ryuzu lying on the ground, ready to reap everything on the earth once unleashed.

Emilia: [――Subaru!]

Before the light of "death" approached and obliterated Subaru's existence, Emilia reached out and deployed an ice barrier, which collided head-on with it.

At the same time, Subaru's collar was pulled and his body fell to the ground at Emilia's feet. In front of Subaru's eyes, the fake Ryuzu, who was closer to the light than Subaru, was engulfed by the white light and disappeared.

Perhaps this was always the case.

That white light was aimed at the fake Ryuzu and was released. Her presence became the marker to aim the white light, and the aftermath of the impact swallowed Subaru and the others, as well as the coupled dragon carriage.

It becomes a living target of overwhelmingly powerful artillery fire as it travels into the midst of the enemy. ――no, it's a dead target, because they are dead. In any case, the originator was completely crazy.

Subaru: [That damn idiot Valga Cromwell――!]

Julius: [Al Clauseria!]

Subaru's heartfelt cry was met by Julius' chant as he pointed the tip of his sword toward the light.

The rainbow-colored aurora that was created, its brilliance collided with the white light like a wall, along with multiple ice barriers created by Emilia, barely stopped the light from shattering it.

The white light of destruction and the protective ice wall covered with an aurora of light.

Unlike the last time, when they had no choice but to attack without sufficient preparation, there was time to formulate strategies against the white light. This was the reason why Emilia and Julius were able to resist the attack compared to the last time.

But still――,

Emilia: [Ugh, yaaaah――!]

Julius: [Guh, kuu…]

With desperation in their voices, Emilia and Julius fought against the white light.

But what kind of power is it that these two could not push it away? Subaru, unable to do anything in this situation, can only support Emilia at her back.

Subaru: [Hang in there! You two, keep it up!]

Gritting his molars, and unable to provide physical support, Subaru shouts out psychological support.

Hopefully, that would inspire the two of them and give them the strength to extinguish the white light completely, but sometimes things do not work out that way.

No matter what the situation, salvation would not be suddenly offered out of the void.

No matter how much one prayed or wished, one cannot use cards that have not been dealt to win the game.

That is why――,

???: [――Well done for calling me, great, great.]

Yes, a carefree voice contrasted with the urgency of the situation, and Subaru held his breath.

Someone walked out next to them. At that point, the person patted Subaru's head with a large hand and walked out in front of Emilia and Julius, as though they were taking a stroll.

The two are also surprised by the sudden behavior of the other person――,

???: [This is the death trap?]

As soon as they said it, the figure advanced in front of the three, waved an arm they had pulled out of their sleeves, and tossed something into the white light.

The light has the power to swallow everything and turn it into dust, and beyond the barrier that Emilia and Julius used to hold it back, they too will be swallowed up and wiped away.

Or so it seemed.

Emilia: [No way…]

Emilia's amethyst eyes widened as she let out a gasp.

The reflection in her beautiful eyes was not the white death that had been so close at hand, but the night sky with thick clouds, which had disappeared without a trace, and gouged out in the shape of the light.

Witnessing the same thing, both Subaru and Julius were speechless.

The ice wall clad in an aurora that collided with the light also disappeared, and the fake Ryuzu, who had used herself as a target, disappeared into the light, leaving nothing behind――,

???: [It was thanks to the young blue oni lady who called me. But you three did a great job. Do you want some candy?]

While saying that, the strongest Wolfman of the City-States, who wiped out the overwhelming death with his hand―― turned around and smiled at the stunned Subaru and the others.

Then, his hand fumbled in his clothing, and he tilted his head, a kiseru still in his mouth,

???: [Oh, I don't got any candy.]

And then, he waved an empty hand in the air, forcing the exhausted Subaru to fall on his buttocks.
