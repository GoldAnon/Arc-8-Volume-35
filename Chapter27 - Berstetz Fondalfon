*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Lamia: [Berstetz, I'm entrusting this situation to you. Stand firm, even if it means your death.]

Berstetz: [Yes, your Excellency. Please ensure your own safety.]

――That was the last conversation they exchanged.

If asked whether their bond was based on a so-called strong connection beyond a mere professional master-servant relationship, the answer would be no.

 Still, sensing a great potential in her intellect and demeanor, with the wisdom accumulated over years, he sought to pave her path, guiding her towards the throne where an emperor should sit. 

Even without a direct display of loyalty or passion towards her, their master-servant relationship was genuine.

Even without being instructed from one to ten, this individual, once they understood one, could comprehend a hundred and create a hundred and one. 

She was someone who, commensurate with her abilities, fulfilled her duties fitting her position and was able to set standards for both herself and others.

Not blessed with martial prowess and always yearning to be the sword wolf of the empire, yet never quite reaching it. 

Being unable to live in any way other than being scorned without garnering respect from others, the fact that she deemed him useful was perhaps something worthy of gratitude.

Thus, there wasn't a shred of deception in the last words they exchanged.

During the Imperial Selection Ceremony, he was sternly commanded to stand his ground, even if it meant risking his life, and he was resolved to do so.

Unable to proclaim himself a Sword-wolf, it was the final service of a man who was simply growing old.

Even though he was a passionless squire, he was determined to be a martyr to his duty.

And yet, Berstetz survived.

And the master, who had prayed for his safety, lost her life.

To this day, Berstetz Fondalfon continues to live in shame. 

Without fulfilling his duties and pursuing the position of the emperor that leads the empire towards decline, he remains unaware of the schemes behind the "Great Disaster" that unfolded. To call himself a 'sword wolf' now would be nothing short of hubris and disgrace.

Despite not fulfilling any of the commands given to him, he continues to live, exposing his shame to the world.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Why, Ralfon? What's come over you?]

???: [Isn't this quite uncharacteristic for someone with a fondness for the Vollachia royal family?]

???: [Or perhaps, you no longer favor me since I was defeated in the Imperial Selection Ceremony?]

The same voice emanated from different mouths, and Goz Ralfon found himself under the unrelenting gaze of countless golden eyes.

Goz Ralfon, clad in golden armor of the same color as those eyes, distorted the scars on his face and gritted his molars at the horrifying reality reflected in his own eyes.

With all his might, he thrust down with his hammer-like spear.

The blood of the Empire's Sword Wolf coursed through Goz's veins, screaming in defiance as he struck down Lamia, a respected member of the royal family, now deemed an enemy.

Torn apart by the soul-crushing pain of his actions, Goz finally grasped the grim truth.

 ――The "Great Disaster" is undeniably the threat that threatens to destroy the Vollachian Empire.

Goz: [Why...?!]

As Goz's teeth ground together in rage, before him stood Lamia ――or rather, multiple Lamias, tilting their heads in unison.

The sight of her cascading orange hair slipping over her slender shoulders fanned the flames of anger within Goz.

Goz: [Why do you allow this mockery?! Such... Such blasphemy! You are making a mockery of her Excellency Lamia's life!]

Riding on his surging anger, Goz's voice trembled, as the impending tears were seared away by his boiling blood. He addressed the countless copies of Lamia before him.

However, in response to Goz's heartfelt plea, the Lamias collectively placed the back of their hands to their lips, then playfully said,

Lamia: [Don't misunderstand, General First-Class Ralfon. This is something I did on my own, not something someone else made me do..]

Goz: [...What do you mean?]

Lamia: [That Witch is rather rigid in her thinking. If I can resurrect from shattered fragments, then I can certainly bring myself back before being shattered. Containers can be made endlessly. All I need to do is dilute and replenish the source. Once you grasp that sensation―― well, you can achieve something as dreamlike as this, can't you?]

With a devilish brilliance, Lamia Godwin, her pale face painted with a flush of mischief, proudly displayed the many versions of herself, mirroring her wit from when she was alive.

Goz: [—――]

Seeing the 'dreamlike' state Lamia described, Goz could not help but inwardly agree.

Lamia, endlessly multiplying, blasphemously replicating her own existence. And each one of these Lamiass bore the "Yang Sword," the symbol of the empire.

If this wasn't a dream――or rather a nightmare, then what was it?

Lamia: [You know, General First-Class Ralfon, you can't shatter dreams in reality. Why not accept that... and perhaps join us on our side?]

Goz: [—What do you mean?]

Lamia: [It's not complicated. If you were to die, you'd be in the same position as me and the others. Why not choose the winning side sooner rather than later?]

Lamia, her hands clasping her sword in front of her and tilting her head, beckoned Goz.

If one were to fall in battle, they would join the ranks of Lamia's undead army. It was a reality unfolding on the battlefield, but imagining it brought an unbearable weight on one's psyche.

The staunchly loyal imperial soldier, Goz, and the soldiers who shared his sentiments would, upon falling, align with those aiming to destroy the empire without a second thought.

Just as Lamia Godwin, who once vied for the throne of the empire's empress, had done.

What would be realized there is an empire of the undead—a shadowless nation of the sword wolves.

Goz: [With all due respect, your Excellency Lamia!]

After tightly shutting his eyes, Goz lifted his face and confronted Lamia. 

In the face of Goz's intense spirit, Lamia's beautifully arched eyebrows furrowed as she frowned.

Lamia: [You seem poised to refuse.]

Goz: [Generous as your mercy is, You Excellency Lamia! I, Goz Ralfon, must respectfully decline!]

Lamia: [As expected, you've turned me down.]

Against Lamia's narrowed golden eyes, Goz thought of the vision he had seen in his moment of closed introspection.

The vision where he, life extinguished, became an undead like Lamia and the others, his pale face bearing those golden eyes, wielding his mace to destroy the empire. He shattered that vision into pieces.

With a fierce scream, he broke free from the haunting vision.

Goz: [I must correct my earlier statement! While I said that none of the «Nine Divine Generals» are entirely under the Emperor's control, I am a loyal pawn of His Majesty! Regardless of what others may do, I alone wish to remain so!]

Rejecting the fate of becoming a harbinger of destruction in death, he yearned to remain a living servant of His Majesty, the Emperor.

That was Goz Ralfon's way of being as the Empire's sword-wolf, his desired path.

Deep thoughts, lofty ideals, he left everything to his ruler, Vincent, intending only to fulfill his designated role.

That is to say――,

Goz: [I am the Fifth of the Nine Divine Generals chosen by Emperor Vincent Vollachia! I am Goz Ralfon!]

He raised his golden mace, declaring his stand against the countless Lamias without taking a single step back.

The next moment, the multitude of Lamias, brandishing their «Yang Swords», lunged at Goz, who had so boldly proclaimed himself. With one strike, the blazing fire of Vollachia that could incinerate even the soul.

But before it could touch him, Goz's muscles pulsated, and his mace swept through the air.

Goz: [――Hk!]

With unwavering intent, Goz's swing took the airborne Lamia, smashing together about five of them in one fell swoop, turning their delicate, porcelain-like bodies to dust.

Witnessing this display, the remaining Lamias widened their eyes, their expressions changing. 

They gazed at the obstinately straightforward Sword Wolf and smiled cruelly.

Lamia: [No matter how bravely you roar and rampage, once you're dead, you'll be my slave, won't you?]

Goz: [If that fate is inevitable! Then I shall turn to stone before my life expires! I shall remain undying, to offer my final act of loyalty to the Emperor!]

He swung his mace overhead, poised to ensure none of the gathered Lamias would escape. 

If the Lamias wielding the «Yang Swords» scatter throughout the chained dragon carriages, their radiant light might sear the eyes of Vincent. He was determined to prevent that.

And for that purpose, the colossal form of the Lion Knight was ever-present. In his fury, Goz Ralfon raged on.

△▼△▼△▼△

Lamia: [――It seems you're quite determined and brave. But alas, it's a pity.]

At the forefront of the chained dragon carriage, heading towards its destination, Goz Ralfon roared fiercely, staking his very existence on preventing the carriage from being stopped.

His spirit and determination were commendable, but unfortunately, his hopes would not be realized.

Despite Goz's desperate attempts to keep the undead-transformed Lamias at bay, they had already reached other parts of the chained dragon carriage.

Of course, they would. There's no need for them to increase only in one spot. They weren’t bound by such limitations. While Goz’s valiant efforts were not entirely in vain, their impact was minimal.

Moreover, in a dragon carriage carrying only those who played a crucial role in the empire, the significance of keeping a formidable entity like Goz Ralfon occupied was evident.

Lamia: [It's a pity, but you're not the one holding me back, General Ralfon. I am the one restraining you.]

As Goz desperately fends off the Yang Sword, trying to dampen his spirits, Lamia, heading for the central carriage, glances afar.

In the distant sky, there’s a figure of a wolf-man clashing mightily with a massive dragon, dark as storm clouds.

Lamia: [It's unexpected that Valgren is unavailable, but successfully keeping him occupied is a significant achievement.]

From between her narrowed golden eyes, Lamia saw how exceptional was the wolf-man seen with Valgren.

While Goz, one of the empire's Nine Generals, was undoubtedly among the world's mightiest warriors, the entity that surpassed even him was in combat with arguably the world's strongest creature.

――No, on the contrary, the malevolent dragon was the one being overwhelmed.

The only reason it wasn't completely overtaken was because of its rapid recovery ability that surpassed the attacks. Even when shattered time and time again, the shinobi couldn't finish off the ever-regenerating dragon.

It was an unusual sight, just by the fact that the dragon couldn’t be killed.

Lamia: [But, it's a pity. That wolf-man won't be of use even if he dies.]

???: [――That's something I can't let slide.]

Soft footsteps could be heard, followed by the raspy voice, prompting Lamia to slowly turn around.

In the same direction as Lamia, watching the battle between the dragon and the wolf-man from the corner of her eye, stood a blonde man――no, a boy.

Lamia snorted lightly and cast a smile at the boy.

Lamia: [You have the scent of a beast. You're a half-breed, aren't you?]

Garfiel: […I don't wanna hear that from a woman who smells like dirt. But no, that ain't just it.]

Lamia: [――?]

Garfiel: [Havin' multiple faces of the same woman... one Nanna's more 'n enough for me]

With a firm clap of his fists in front of his chest, the half-beast boy declared, causing Lamia and the other Lamias to narrow their eyes.

The meaning behind the boy's proclamation was unclear. All that was evident was that the boy had previously encountered a place where beings of the same appearance, much like the Lamias now, were in multitude.

Furthermore――,

Garfiel: [I ain't sayin' I'm best buds with that golden oldie, but that old man's voice sure is deafenin'... Outta all the folks here, I know ya're the toughest one for my amazin' self to deal with!]

Lamia: [――――]

Indeed, just after the boy bared his fangs and snarled, Lamia sensed a shift in the atmosphere.

It was a change in the linked dragon carriages – if the entire procession was divided into five parts, Lamia was facing off with the boy at the third carriage. This change was different from the resistance Goz was putting up at the first carriage – it was happening at the second and fourth carriages.

The roof of the second carriage was engulfed in flames, while the fourth was encased in a freezing wind, turning icy.

Both instances involved carriages occupied by other Lamias and members of the Pruning Corps.

Sensing this reality on her skin, Lamia touched the back of her hand to her lips and chuckled.

Lamia: [It seems people from the kingdom really struggle to let things go.]

Garfiel: [...How'd you figure my amazin’ self’s from Lugunica?]

Lamia: [I just found out. You didn't seem very imperial, so I just asked. Adorable, isn't it?]

Garfiel: [Nah, that ain’t it. You ain't just teasing my amazin’ self for the fun of it.]

As he observed Lamia's mocking smile, the boy shook his head.

It wasn't sour grapes, nor was it insight. If anything, it was the boy's intuition: a primal, innate ability to discern truth from lies.

He connected the dots between his own instincts and Lamia's earlier words.

Garfiel: [Between the talk that The Admirer ain't usable 'n yer disappointment 'bout where my amazin' self's from...]

Lamia: [――Enough chatter.]

Clearly, he was a boy who tried to think despite not being naturally inclined to it. 

Watching someone earnestly attempt what they're unsuited for was terribly irksome to Lamia.

As Lamia lightly shrugged her slender shoulders, another Lamia, in response, lunged at the boy. 

Ducking down, he dodged the sharp red blade, counter-punching Lamia's abdomen with the back of his fist. But, as one Lamia was blown away, another slashed through it. The split body of the Lamia ignited, and from behind the curtain of flames, a lethal thrust targeted the boy.

With a short bark, the boy kicked off the roof, leaping into the air. 

A zombie-flying dragon approached, gliding smoothly, and seized the airborne boy in its jaws. Clutching him, the undead dragon ascended, soon joined by a swarm of its kin.

Lamia: [Like General Ralfon, anyone who needs to get close finds the 'Yang Sword' quite disagreeable.]

Tightening her grip on the untouched Yang Sword, Lamia remarked at the boy now swarmed by the zombie-flying dragons.

With just one slash of the Yang Sword, its flames would burn a soul until nothing remained. The magical blade's effect, which boosted the physical abilities of the wielder, could transform even the pampered Vollachia royalty into first-class fighters. 

And for someone who'd dedicated time to the art of the sword, its benefits were immeasurable.

Lamia: [Now then, with the beastly-smelling boy out of the way, it's time to find where my Nii-sama is...]

Just as Lamia was about to leisurely step forward, an unexpected roar echoed above her. 

The mass of zombie-flying dragons, which had amassed into a sphere-like formation, exploded in mid-air, shattering into pieces in mid-air. Emerging from the center of this explosion was a mighty, gigantic tiger, in stark contrast to the earlier slender and agile boy.

The tiger, with limbs as thick as bundles of logs, swung its mighty arms, scattering the swarm of dragons. It then plummeted, its weight making the roof of the chained dragon carriage creak. In an instant, it lunged at Lamia.

Lamia: [――――]

Whirling around, Lamia slashed the Yang Sword from below.

She was momentarily taken aback. However, the transformation into a beast made him a larger target. Against a wielder of the Yang Sword, where a mere graze could ensure victory, this was a tactical error.

The oncoming tiger, its chest exposed, was met with the sweeping strike of the Yang Sword――,

Garfiel: [――Hk!!]

Lamia: [Oh, my...]

The tip of the Yang Sword scraped against steel, and Lamia's golden eyes widened in surprise.

The charging giant tiger didn't slam its thick arm at Lamia as expected. Instead, it dug its claws into the roof a half-step in front of her, forcibly tearing it off to use as a shield.

Lamia's sword stroke merely glided off this makeshift barrier, and the spinning tiger's other arm struck her squarely.

The impact tore away Lamia's upper body, and her shattered form was hurled outside the carriage.

The tiger had surpassed Lamia's expectations. Yet, much like Goz, this seemed a futile effort.

Lamia: [Even if I were to die...]

Lamia, crumbling to dust before hitting the ground, whispered through her fading lips.

Even if this body perished, she would simply regenerate, just like her other selves. Moreover, the advantage of this regeneration was not just the fact she wouldn't die.

The next Lamia to rise would inherit all of this Lamia's experiences.

Which meant――,

Lamia: [――――]

As she fell, while sensing the approach of other Lamias and the Pruning Corps towards the giant tiger, her breaking field of vision caught a glimpse inside the dragon carriage she was leaving behind.

Inside that carriage, her eyes met with someone gazing out of the window. She had confirmed which carriage her quarry was in and could pass this information to the next Lamia.

Lamia: [――Found you, Vincent-nii-sama.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Berstetz: [――Your Excellency.]

It was undoubtedly Lamia Godwin, revived as undead, having just now been shaken off the roof and smashed to the ground.

With his own eyes, Berstetz had already confirmed this fact.

As soon as he saw that the Pruning Corps, whom he was well acquainted with, was participating in this fierce assault on the dragon carriage, he knew full well that it was Lamia who was leading it.

Still, the sight of Lamia's body shattered and reduced to dust shook Berstetz.

Serena: [I had hoped to see it at least once, but I didn't expect it to be like this.]

Berstetz: [High Countess Dracroy...]

Serena: [Don't look at me like that, Prime Minister. You saw the same thing I did. If Her Excellency Lamia was crushed like that, it might stop her private army, the Pruning Corps? Am I understanding that right?

Berstetz: [――――]

Serena: [It doesn't look very promising, though.]

The undead Lamia met her end outside the car window, and Serena, smiling, shrugged her shoulders.

She spoke with dim expectations, and even though Lamia, to whom she had given her loyalty, was killed, there was not a shred of hope with regard to the onslaught of the Pruning Corps.

Based on the previous discussion at the military conference, death was not the end for the undead.

The Sphinx, the main perpetrator of the "Great Disaster," aimed to use even death to destroy the Empire. After all, if Witch could do it, what could The Poison Princess do?

Even without witnessing the undeminished spirit of the Pruning Corps, the end of Lamia was surely ahead of them.

"Anastasia-sama、お下がりください！"
Julius: [Anastasia-sama, please stand back!]

Raising a dignified voice, a young man in Waso wielded a flowing sword.

The rainbow-colored slash easily sliced through the solid black armor of the Pruning Corps as if it were hot steel slicing through ice.

Even Berstetz, who was not blessed with martial prowess, could see that this young man―― Julius, was no less capable than the Imperial's finest warriors.

Anastasia: [But even my Julius can't fight forever. We have to move the situation forward.]

Anastasia muttered as she stroked the scarf around her neck, defended by Julius's struggle.

Julius and Garfiel respectively were fighting the enemy inside the carriage and on the roof, but along with Lamia, who fell earlier, both inside and outside were in a fierce battle.

It is a situation in which all the personnel who can fight were fighting, including the guards.

Ubilk: [Even so, don't you feel like you're being targeted a bit too much?"

Anastasia: [Maybe so, but isn't it because you're here? I can see that sore on your chest, it looks like it's been marked up pretty good.]

Ubilk: [Mark…? Oh crap, it's true!]

Ubilk, taken out of the confinement room, looked down at his open chest and raised his voice.

As Anastasia said, there were traces of a red worm sore on his white skin, which she glimpsed, and if it had occurred at the same time as the attack――,

Berstetz: [A Evil Eye to grasp the whereabouts of the target… No way, His Excellency Palladio Manesque?"

Serena: [Ah, I see, will the all the participants of the Imperial Selection Ceremony be here? Then I would like to reminisce with His Excellency Barthroy, who sent me flowers when I took the governorship from my father.]

The Evil Eye of Palladio Manesque, Prince of Vollachia, heir to the blood of the Evil Eye tribe, captured the target, which is why the Pruning Corps was constantly attacking this place.

Berstetz guessed so, and Serena, who herself used her sword to keep the enemy in check, licked her lips,

Serena: [If we move from this place, we don't want to die because we made a choice between the front and the back. If we are defeated, the empire is as good as dead not just the head, but from the waist up. It will be interesting to see if there is any other way for such a creatures to die…"

Berstetz: [...I hope you do not think I am being impertinent. I am not a man like him, but I can never be replaced by His Excellency or by you.]

Serena: [No one is irreplaceable, Prime Minister. Indeed, I am in awe of you, just as I am in awe that you were appointed to represent His Excellency, the Emperor. Anyway――"

Serena, who never loses her bitterness under any circumstance, was moved when she took a jab at Berstetz's conduct in the Imperial Capital.

The choice emerged from the choice, the choice of which way to move, forward or backward.

???: [There you are! You’ve been standing your ground here huh!]

Anastasia: [Natsuki-kun!]

Crossing the threshold of the back door, which had already been breached by the Pruning Corps, a small silhouette rushed into the carriage where Berstetz and the others were.

At the sight of the black-haired boy leading a group, Anastasia raised her voice in welcome.

Those who had hurriedly arrived were the boy named Natsuki Subaru, and a girl in a dress holding his hand. Following them were a deer girl, a girl with blond hair, and two women with identical features apart from one having pink hair and the other having blue hair——.

Julius : [Subaru! What happened to Emilia-sama?]

Subaru: [Emilia-tan is fighting hard at the rear section! She's freezing the vehicle to reinforce it so that the enemies can't get in, had we stayed, we'd have ended up frozen too!]

Anastasia: [How forceful. …But, it's a winnin’ move.]

Subaru answered Julius’s question, which was asked as he faced an undead breaking through the window and forced it out. Anastasia closed one eye and muttered at the response of the boy who was frowning, and directed her light blue gaze behind him——towards the blonde girl.

Girl: [Aau…]

Anastasia: [Given all this, was ya talk interrupted?]

Subaru: [——No, I had already concluded my discussion. It's just the opportunity to convey it to everyone that's been interrupted. What about that bastard Abel? Doesn't he have the same mark as me?]

Lining up beside the blonde girl, Subaru spoke thus and pointed to a spot on his chest. Thereupon, a raised welt-like mark identical to the one on the Stargazer Ubilk stood out. 

As soon as he noticed it, Ubilk loudly exclaimed “Aah!”,

Ubilk: [See, I knew it! You've got the marking on you! Doesn’t that mean we're fellow Stargazers!]

Subaru: [I keep telling you that’s not it! It's not just me, it's the same on cute Beako, and I feel sorry for her! What do we have in common!]

???: [——Most likey, it is marking the obstacles that need to be eliminated for the Great Disaster]

The voice this time, had come from the door opposite from where Subaru and the others had entered, and the owner rushed in from the corridor that led to the car towards the front.

Appearing side by side were Otto, the Kingdom's tactician who had exerted a strong influence in the war councils, and a girl who had been actively participating in healing the wounded soldiers.

Upon their entry, Subaru turned around, his eyes wide in surprise,

Subaru: [Otto! Petra! Are you both okay? I'm sorry about earlier!]

Otto: [Let us leave that discussion for later. Now we need to share crucial information.]

Petra: [The mark you were saying appeared on Subaru and Beatrice-chan, it has appeared on Master too! Right now, Master is in the dragon carriage ahead, drawing the zombies to him…]

Ram: [Roswaal-sama also has the mark…]

Upon hearing the report from the girl called Petra, the woman with pink hair, likely a relative of Rem, cast her eyes downward.

However, if not only Ubilk, Subaru, and the girl named Beatrice, but also the Kingdom's court magician had the mark, then the qualification for being marked had become somewhat apparent.

That being——,

Anastasia: [——Margrave Mathers and Beatrice-chan who had directly faced Sphinx on the plains. Also, Natsuki-kun who had stopped the surprise attack on the dragon carriage, ‘n Stargazer-san as well.]

Berstetz: [It cannot be confirmed from here, but there is a possibility that the same marking has also been carved on Halibel-san, who is fighting with that black dragon outside] 

Serena: [And also His Excellency the Emperor. It’s quite likely. Every one of those named, are all irreplaceable in their abilities.]

Serena made a quick jab at Berstetz’s prior comment, while agreeing with the opinions of the experts.

With the discussion started by Anastasia and the others, Berstetz also concurred. As long as the effect of Palladio's Evil Eye persisted, endless assassins would be sent after the targeted ones.

However——,

Rem: [Wait, please. If that guess is correct, I don’t understand why the same marking has not emerged on this child…on Spica-chan] 

The one who voiced this was Rem, who was holding onto a small girl’s shoulders from behind.  

The girl she called Spica, although her importance had not been detailed, they were told that she was one of those named in Ubilk's prophecy.

In that regard, there is no doubt that she is an important person for the Vollachian Empire――,

Otto: [Spica?]

At Rem's appeal, Otto mutters with a different emotion than Berstetz and the others.

Hearing his muttering, Subaru looked at Otto and became serious,

Subaru: [I've decided where I stand. The proof will be in the way of life from here on.]

Otto: [――. Odd coincidence, isn't it? I just decided to make a decision to stand as well.]

It is impossible for an outsider to guess how many complex emotions were involved in this quiet exchange. In addition, in the midst of this attack, it is a situation that should be put on the back burner.

Right now, the top priority should be――,

Ram: [We should get a move on before Garf, who is howling above our heads, turns into a grilled tiger.]

Subaru: [Don't make it sound like grilled chicken… But earlier, Rem had a point.]

Subaru nodded at the pink-haired girl's words, and when he turned around, everyone's eyes focused on the girl named Spica. The girl growled in her throat at the concentration of their gazes and looked around with a puzzled face.

Beatrice: [If this Stargazer is to be believed, this girl… Spica is the natural enemy of the Great Disaster, in fact. So then why is she being overlooked, I suppose?]

Petra: [――? Is that really so weird? I mean, we would have never known about it if that guy hadn't told us about it, right? So it's just that they don't know either.]

Subaru: [...So does that mean there is no Stargazer on the undead’s side?]

Subaru muttered with realization at the girls' exchange of questions.

Ubilk turned around at the remark, but shook his head loosely with an unreliable look on his face,

Ubilk: [yeaaah, sorry, I don't even know that, It's not related my commandment.]

Rem: [If so, can you at least tell me what it is about Spica-chan that you say is a shining light? It would be irresponsible to just appoint her.]

Ubilk: [Sooorry, that was irresponsible.]

Ubilk's defiant expression turned Rem's face a tense color. but Ubilk's answer was less than desirable, but Rem's skewed topic may be worth considering.

???: [At this point, with the materials we have at our disposal, we have no choice but to use the coupled dragon carriage to charge into the Fortified City, which may cause it to break up in mid-air, while protecting what who have been marked. That city is supposedly still being repaired, too.]

Subaru: [I don't think we have that much time left.]

Even as they spoke, the dragon carriage was slowly losing its original appearance under the attack of the Pruning Corps. As previously discussed, if it stops moving, it will inevitably be destroyed.

To stop this battle, they must deal with the enemy commander―― Lamia, who was leading the enemy.

Berstetz: [――――]

With more than coping mechanisms at hand, Berstetz notices in his narrow, thread-narrow vision that Subaru had a terribly conflicted expression on his face. The anguish that occupied his face is the result of realizing something and hesitating to say what it is.

A statement that the boy hesitates to utter in this situation. His conflict is different from Serena's, who does not examine her statements carefully enough, and the content of her conflict was――,

Ram: [――Barusu.]

Otto: [Natsuki-san.]

At the same time, two people called out to Subaru.

Much like Berstetz, they must have noticed the change in the boy's facial expression. And the two, who knew the boy better than Berstetz, were able to understand what was troubling him.

Closing his eyes to the intent of their gazes, Subaru took a deep breath and tightened his expression,

Subaru: [――Spica's Authority could be the breakthrough in this situation.]
 
△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Oryaaaah~!]

Wielding barbarian swords in both hands, Medium forcefully cut down the undead approaching in front of her.

As a result of that large swing, her back side was left exposed, and another pair of undead great shears were about to strike her. However, a slender long sword intervened in its path.

???: [Don't mess with me so lightly, you big fucks!]

The one who howled and slashed wildly was a one-eyed imperial soldier who called himself Jamal.

Working with Jamal, Medium struggled to protect her brother Flop, Jamal's sister Katya, and the self-indulgent Abel from the constant attacks of the undead.

Even now, Medium stops her foe in its tracks with her front kick, cuts off its head with her barbarian sword, and turns the undead to dust; Jamal also cuts his foe's knees with his twin swords, skewers its chest, and destroys it.

Jamal: [Empress! I'll take care of this, just stay back!]

Medium: [Like~I~Said! I haven't said yes yet!]

Jamal: [Prospective Empress! Stay back!]

Medium: [Geez~!]

Medium, not accustomed to being treated so respectfully, could not hide her bewilderment.

It had been that way since Flop and Abel's earlier discussion; although warned by Abel, Medium cooperated with her brother without asking anything of Flop's thoughts.

In hindsight, she should have listened to Abel a bit first.

Medium: [Then I wouldn't have been so surprised…]

Flop: [Dear sister! Worrying doesn't suit you!]

Medium: [Whose fault is it that, big bro!]

Placing her passion into her sword, she puts all her strength into her legs as she grapples with the great shears being thrust out at her. A blade is thrust from under its armpit, and Jamal, who turned back, pierced it through the chest and killed the enemy.

Jamal did so, scrapped his twin swords together in mid-air,

Jamal: [Katya! Don't get impatient! I'm not letting anything near you!]

Katya: [Ju-just stop it… I don't care anymore… There's nothing good about living anyway…]

Jamal: [Don't be stupid! If you die, Todd won't be able to live without you!]

Katya: [――Hk, My, my brother's stupid...! Are you going to say it? Yo-you wouldn't say that, would you? Die! D-die brother...!]

Katya, sitting in her wheelchair, starts to weep when a name is mentioned that Medium did not know. Now Medium feels very sorry for Katya. If it weren't for this situation, she would like to listen to her as a younger sister who is being pushed around by her brother.

But there was no room for that anymore.

Because――,

???: [――The word Empress isn't something to be ignored, is it not?]

Medium: [――Hk.]

???: [I wonder if you are qualified to serve alongside the sword-wolves among the sword-wolves?]

The one who tilted their head was a very beautiful undead from Medium's point of view, standing out from the black-armored undead who were rushing toward them.

If it weren't for her pale skin and eerie golden eyes, she would have been a beauty to behold.

Whether the power of her words came from her being dead or from her time alive, but her words were remarkably intimidating, which Medium was unable to answer back.

Vincent: [Whatever answer the girl gives you, it would be of no use, since you are already dead.]

And so it was Abel, not Medium, who answered back.

Abel and his beautiful undead stared at each other with Medium, Jamal, and undead soldiers in between, from the front of the carriage to the very back. ――Abel and his beautiful undead stared at each other.

???: [Hello, Vincent-niisama. You look as dignified as ever. maybe you have lost some weight...?]

Vincent: [Just when I think my brothers and sisters are no longer pestering me, you and Palladio appear to have wandered back. It is inevitable that my cheeks will be a bit gaunt.]

???: [Fufu, it's tempting to wander off and get lost. ――I'm sure Prisca helped you, Onii-sama.]

Vincent: [――――]

???: [I wonder if you are qualified to punish me and Palladio-nii-sama when it was you, Onii-sama, who broke the premise of the Imperial Selection Ceremony? If the truth were known, no one would recognize you as emperor, would they?]

With a giggle, the undead princess laughed with her hand covering her mouth.

Abel's black eyes shook slightly at her words. With those eyes, Abel tried to say something back to her but――,

Medium: [Nobody cares! I think Abel-chin is the Emperor!]

Jamal: [Me too, Your Excellency Emperor! There is no need to listen to a dead woman!]

Unable to hold back, Medium and the voice of Jamal, who had taken advantage of the situation, shook the carriage.

Abel's eyes widen even more than before at the two's statement, and the princess narrowed her eyes. She looked at Medium and Jamal with golden eyes, peculiar of the undead.

???: [Do tell me. Do these soldiers over there have any clue who I am?"

Jamal: [Huh? By the looks of it, you're part of the royal family of Vollachia, but what does it matter when you're dead? A dead guy is a loser, and a living guy is a Sword-wolf! That's it! That's the Imperial way!]

Shouting with the world's most obvious logic, Jamal renews the melee with the enemy soldiers.

At the sheer momentum of it, Medium laughed after she blinked her eyes. Medium, like Jamal, resumed the fight.

Medium: [You're cooler than Abel-chin, Jamal-chin!]

Jamal: [How awe-inspiring, Empress!]

Jamal's twin swords raged with a wild grin at Medium's praise.

The confrontation between Abel and the princess continued, with the fight in between. Abel's black eyes narrowed at the princess's slightly displeased appearance,

Vincent: [――I sense the presence of many Yang Swords. You are not alone, Lamia.]

Lamia: [What if it is? Would you be happy to have more cute little sisters? Or is it that Vincent-nii-sama is not interested because they are not Prisca?"

Vincent: [So if you are using the mechanisms of the undead to cause events outside of reason, why do you not put a number of them in front of me?"

Abel was not taken in by the taunting attitude of the Princess ――Lamia. Abel was not at all concerned with Lamia's attitude, but he found a clue in her silence.

Abel looked at his sister, who had no doubt changed, in his narrowed black eyes,

Vincent: [There is a limited number of you. Plus, most of them are being bogged down. ――By Goz.]

Lamia: [You say that so matter-of-factly, Onii-sama. If that were true, General First-Class Ralfon's efforts would be a matter of honor, wouldn't they? Poor guy, saying he's merely a pawn...]

Vincent: [――And hence the choice.]

In a quiet tone, Abel interrupted Lamia.

Abel naturally crossed his arms on the spot and met Lamia's gaze and words directly,

Vincent: [He is one of the Generals I selected. It is only natural that he should work to that capacity.]

After stating so matter-of-factly, Abel continued by calling her name, "Lamia".

Then, to Lamia, who looked at him, eyes slightly widened.

Vincent: [I never thought of you as anything but an insignificant thing.]

Lamia: [――――]

Lamia's expression changed dramatically at the words spoken to her.

Up until then, she had looked fascinated, sadistic, and otherwise dissatisfied, but at Abel's words, she had a different look on her face.

Her golden eyes widened, and she bit her lip.

Lamia: [――Vincent Vollachiaaaa!!]

The next moment, the expression that Medium had seen was wiped away as if it were a lie, and a different face appeared.

Her golden eyes flashed with fury as she reached into the air and drew her red, shining, treasured sword.

With her shining treasured sword in hand, Lamia stepped forward, kicked off the floor, kicked off the wall, slipped through the gap between the undead, and leaped at Abel.

A radiance, as if flames or light itself were shining down, brightly illuminated the undead-filled interior of the carriage and attempted to extinguish Abel from her mind.
 
Abel stared straight at it, and the treasured sword swung down toward his nose.

Medium: [Abel-chin!]

Kicking the undead, she jumped apart, and Medium caught the treasured sword with her barbarian sword. After a moment of hesitation, Medium's barbarian sword melted, and the trajectory of the treasure sword flowed unchanged.

Jamal: [His Excellency, the Emperor!]

A moment later, Jamal's twin swords go to knock away the treasured sword, just as Medium did. It, too, was engulfed by the treasured sword's radiance, and the blade vanished in an instant.

Breaking through Medium and Jamal's obstructions, Lamia's sword strike reached Abel.
 
Just like that, Abel's whole body was engulfed by the red light, and Medium began to scream.
 
That's when.

???: [――――]

No one knew what had happened.

Not Flop or Katya behind Abel's imposing figure, who pulled Abel's jacket and made him fall on his buttocks on the spot, not Medium, who felt a tremendous pain in her chest at the thought of Abel's death, not Jamal, who looked in despair at the thought of losing it all.

 ――Just there, as if struck by wind, Lamia's body collapsed.

△▼△▼△▼△

Lamia: [To think you would yet live, you are quite tenacious, Berstetz. ――Say, who won the Imperial Selection Ceremony? Vincent-niisama? Or was it Prisca?]

――Those were the first words she had presented to him upon their reunion.

The reunion with his master, whose physical appearance had undergone a radical change.

Even after nine years, when he would close his eyes, he could recall her appearance when she had been alive, almost as if it were yesterday. When humans age, events of the distant past tend to become clearer than what happened the day before.

That was why he only needed a single look to understand the abnormality pertaining to his master.

Her fractured, pallid skin, and her golden eyes that no longer desired the light, were those of the dead who had consigned their life to oblivion.

He had also understood from the initial question she gave him. The clock inside her had stopped ticking. That was right. That was how it should have been. The living and the dead must be kept far apart from each other.

Therefore――,

Berstetz: [――Cease pruning!!]

He barked out the order, raising his voice to the point he thought it might tear apart his parched throat.

Graced by the Divine Protection of Wind Evasion, neither the strong winds that were supposed to batter him nor the violent tremors of the dragon carriage were present, allowing his voice to soar and resound throughout the area.

The moment they heard the command, the undeads equipped with great shears in their hands stopped moving.

The Pruning Corps suddenly halted their movements, and he did not know what to think about that fact. Should he lament it, or should he feel proud?

Entrusting their hearts to the Poison Princess, they were a symbol of fear with cold blood running through their veins. It was Berstetz who had taken them apart and reshaped them into such. They had met his expectations in accordance with his goals.

And even after death, their bodies had reacted to the command of Berstetz Fondalfon.

Berstetz: [Time has stopped for the undead. If so, for them, that battle during the Imperial Selection Ceremony would have had to occur just the day before… What is ingrained in their bodies can never lose its color.]

They had demonstrated the ideal way to follow their master even in death.

Lamia: [――And then? You are only able to subdue my animals for a moment, are you not?]

Berstetz: [...Yes. However, with this, now you are here.]

Turning over towards the voice behind him, Berstetz greeted her in person, alone.

With its roof and walls in ruin, the dragon carriage was a mere shadow of its former sublimity. Despite that, on one of the platforms of the carriage that was laden with the Empire’s hope, Berstetz and Lamia faced off against one another.

Confirming that he was visible in the reflection of Lamia’s golden eyes, Berstetz blew out a breath.

Berstetz: [I have been expecting you, Your Excellency Lamia.]

Lamia: [Yes, it seems that way. But I wonder, why are you here alone?]

Lamia gave a slight tilt of her head, spreading her arms as her eyes scanned over the empty dragon carriage.

Aside from Berstetz, Serena nor those of the Kingdom were present. He had remained here alone because he had a secret plan to immobilize Lamia as well as the Pruning Corps.

As a matter of fact, he had been successful in doing so for the Pruning Corps, even if it would only last for a moment.

Berstetz was certain his commands would never take effect ever again, but he knew his fellow passengers in the dragon carriage were able to utilize the opening he had created with the few seconds of time he bought.

With that, Berstetz had kept his promise to those who had gone ahead of him.

Berstetz: [I am no longer at an age where I would make declarations I cannot keep.]

Lamia: [There is no need to put yourself down like that. Nine years have passed since then, but you really have not changed a bit. You are the same as when I had died.]

Berstetz: [――Perhaps it is as you say, Your Excellency.]

Berstetz responded to Lamia’s teasing words in a low, gravelly voice.

Lamia knitted her brows as she heard that. In front of her, Berstetz balled his bony hand into a fist, clenching his teeth that had miraculously not suffered a single loss.

He had not changed even after nine years. What Lamia said was correct. 

Berstetz: [Since that moment, my time has also come to a standstill, Your Excellency Lamia.]

Berstetz murmured, then took a step forward.

Full of determination, he took a large step. Once his outstretched foot met the floor, he took another. Forcing his elderly body to move, Berstetz continued stepping forward, one at a time.

Lamia: [――――]

Exasperatedly, Lamia narrowed her golden eyes.

Moving along slowly, the flow of time felt sluggish and stagnant. Not only did it feel as such, but it was slow in reality. Compared to Julius and Garfiel, who had been fighting to protect Berstetz and the others until a little while ago, it was terribly feeble to the point making a comparison would be presumptuous. 

He was a sheep painted in black in a pack of wolves. He had become a sly old goat. Making his horns seem larger than they were, he desperately flaunted that he had his own role amongst the wolf pack.

Lamia: [――Yang Sword.]

As Lamia reached out towards the sky, the hilt of the esteemed, crimson sword materialized in her hand.

Her slender fingers squeezed themselves tightly around it, drawing out the treasured sword, the symbol of Vollachia. The fiery red, brilliant inferno trapped within the blade seared his eyes.

He was glad he had narrowed his eyes. Thanks to it, his eyeballs would be protected even if his eyelids had been scorched.

Carrying those trivial, useless thoughts with him, Berstetz lifted up his fist. Curled around one of his fingers was a ring. The proof that he was the Prime Minister of the Vollachian Empire.

It was a Meteor, imbued with Mana of the element of fire.

Lamia: [I have already seen that.]

The coldness in Lamia’s gaze retained its ice, having already seen the Meteor in action at the Imperial Capital, within the Crystal Palace, and inside the throne room.

Berstetz’s advance was terribly slow, and his last resort had already been subjugated once. On the other hand, his opponent possessed one of the ten mystic swords, which wielded power relative to the top echelon of the world――,

Berstetz: [――Your Excellency.]

He knew it would take less than a single second for her to cut him down and reduce him to cinders.

Despite it, out of his life, which spanned close to seventy years so far, Berstetz made full use of the longest second he had lived.

And then, he told his master what he had told her in the past, once again.

Berstetz: [――We have lost…!]

Berstetz threw down his raised fist as he spoke, pointing the ring at the floor.

There, he activated the Meteor. Flames swelled up and burst out beneath his feet, augmenting the elder’s sluggish advance with blazing momentum.

With great intensity, Berstetz’s entire body barreled towards Lamia.

Lamia’s golden eyes had widened upon seeing the old man’s body throw itself at her up close. In those wide, gold-colored optics, there was the reflection belonging to Berstetz Foldalfon.

Gazing into the face Berstetz saw in her eyes, Lamia continued to hold up the Yang Sword, and,

Lamia: [――So, you were capable of making such a frustrated face.]

They were lady and vassal, with a long-lasting affiliation while maintaining a respectable distance, and never had a heart-to-heart conversation with one another.

For the first time, Lamia’s enigmatic vassal displayed an expression that she had never seen before. On that face, full of wrinkles and thin eyes narrowed to the point his pupils were not visible, the elderly man appeared as if he were about to cry. Her hand stilled.

――Berstetz and Lamia’s bodies met each other head-on.

Unable to mitigate the force of the explosion, the two hurtled into the wall of the carriage in a tangle of limbs. They were slated towards the wall that had been torn down by the Pruning Corps’ break-in, and were thrown out, just like that.

Squeezing tightly, with fingers as bare as a withered tree, the elderly man grabbed onto the dress of the beautiful girl and refused to let go.

Without separating from one another, their bodies were forcefully ejected outside of the long dragon carriage――,

△▼△▼△▼△

——In that instant, a shockwave struck all the countless Lamia Godwins that had appeared within the coupled dragon carriages.

Lamia: [————]

The Lamias fighting Goz Ralfon, the Lamias fighting Garfiel Tinzel, the Lamias fighting Roswaal L Mathers, the Lamias fighting Emilia, and the Lamias in the other parts of the dragon carriage, were all simultaneously affected by the shock.

A Divine Protection is a blessing that can be bestowed upon the lives born into this world; its true nature has not been elucidated to this day, and much is still shrouded in mystery.

However, regarding Divine Protections, many held a conviction that they had intuitively understood.

Which was that Divine Protections affected the soul, of the one to whom it was granted and the one on which it was targeted. 

Whether this was true or not, had never been proven. However, this much could be said,

——Berstetz Fondalfon was thrown out of the dragon carriage with one of the Lamia Godwins, and they were both removed from Divine Protection of Wind Evasion simultaneously.

At the same time, one of the Lamia Godwins had slashed at Vincent Vollachia, and as both Medium O’Connel and Jamal Aurélie had failed to block the attack, it was the very moment when tragedy was about to strike in front of Flop O’Connel and Katya Aurélie.

Lamia : [——Hk]

As if struck by the wind, the body of Lamia, who was about to bring down the Yang Sword, was pushed backward.

At this moment, neither Lamia nor the Mediums understood what had happened. The only fact was that Vincent, who had been pulled down, extended his leg and kicked Lamia backward.

Then, behind Lamia, who had been kicked away, the door connecting to the adjacent car was breached——,

Lamia: [————]

A rainbow brilliance sprung forth, and the Pruning Corps standing before the door were cut down.

Slipping past the light of that rainbow, three small silhouettes rolled into the car 

One of them held up their hand, and a faint glow surrounded the three silhouettes, speeding them up as they rolled. The one in the middle, who was holding hands with the previous silhouette, shouted out.

Subaru: [——Lamia Godwin!]

With a raised voice, such was the shout of the black-haired boy holding hands with two girls on either side.

The girl in the dress had produced the glow, the young black-haired boy had called out the name, and the last one who had leapt in, extended a hand other than the one linked with the boy and——,

Spica: [——Iaaiau]

——Shaking off the hand that had touched the back that had come flying towards her, she stripped off the name of the Poison Princess.
