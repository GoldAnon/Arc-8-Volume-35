*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Truly, Natsuki Subaru contemplated, they were in a peculiar relationship.

It was more than peculiar; it was a malevolent string of circumstances that had led Subaru and his companions here.

The Vollachian Empire, whose ideology and existence Subaru despised with every fiber of his being.

Rem, being without her Memories, made him yearn to cry out in frustration.

And Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, whom he found thoroughly despicable, was the one that he blamed for it all.

Cursed with such an unbearable situation, he lamented and raged as expected, colliding again and again with his fate. Subaru lived through these days by dying and dying again.

Yet, there were also people in the Vollachian Empire with whom he had reached out to help.

Rem, devoid of her Memories, whose kindness and deep compassion made him want to weep.

And Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, who had bravely risked her life time and time again for him.

Chewing on the curse that had been served up for him, refusing to follow the path laid before him, causing each other gentle wounds, Subaru lived through these days, dying repeatedly.

To curse, to lament, to hate. Or, to refrain from cursing, to accept, to forgive.

The time had come to put an end to this ambiguous relationship that had continued to exist.

Subaru: [――――]

Subaru's proclamation upon entering the guest room cloaked the space with an air of tense anticipation.

Present in the room were Rem and Louis, joined by Ram and Tanza, totaling four. The former were stakeholders, the latter, witnesses. Subaru wished to converse with them all.

Emilia, Beatrice, and the rest were waiting for a resolution. 

For the answer that Natsuki Subaru would give, no matter what form it took.

Rem: […Has the important discussion with Abel-san concluded?]

Before Subaru, who was considering how to broach the subject, Rem was the first to speak.

Seated beside Louis, with her hand in hers, Rem's words, whether consciously or not, seemed somewhat of a strategic maneuver.

In response to her question, Subaru shook his head.

Subaru: [We're in the middle of an intermission right now. I can't proceed with that discussion until we've resolved some matters here… The discussion with Abel also involves Louis.]

Louis: [Aau?]

Rem: [Why would Louis-chan be involved?]

Subaru: [It's because of the prophecy of the Stargazer guy. It seems that Louis's involvement is crucial for us to win this battle.]

Rem: [――Hk.]

At Subaru's straightforward revelation, a bitter expression crossed Rem's face. Holding Louis's hand, Rem looked at Subaru with her pale blue eyes and said,

Rem: [So, you're saying that you want Louis-chan to fight? Despite her being so small, so innocent, you're suggesting such a cruel thing…]

Subaru: [Whether or not she needs to fight is a question for later. However, let me clarify something first. ――The notion that Louis is a kid who doesn't understand anything is incorrect.]

Rem: [What do you…]

Subaru: [Even though communicating verbally is difficult, Louis clearly understands her situation. She can choose who she wants to side with, and who she doesn't. Knowing that, she is here with us.]

Rem: [That's…]

At Subaru's calm statement, Rem lowered her head, lost for words.

Rem too knew that Subaru's counterargument was the truth. If it were not so, Louis would not be here in the first place.

From the moment they had been cast into the Vollachian Empire, they found themselves in an incomprehensible situation. At first glance, it seemed like Louis was simply imprinted onto Subaru and Rem, acting clingy in such a strange environment. ――However, such a simple explanation would not explain the nature of the myriad of brutal trials that they had endured together.

If this imprinting was not a sign of love, but rather a manifestation of a defensive instinct seeking a protector for survival, it would go without saying that being with Subaru and Rem was detrimental to Louis's survival.

If she merely wanted to survive, it would have been easier for Louis to be without Subaru and his companions.

Ram: [On that point, Ram agrees with Barusu. Although Rem has said bits and pieces of the circumstances, that child being here, despite having been separated from Rem and Barusu, is a result of her own choice.]

Rem: [Nee-sama…]

Ram: [Don't misunderstand, Rem. While Ram is entirely on Rem's side and has firmly resolved to tear Barusu apart together with you later, she won't twist the truth.]

Subaru: [There was a declaration in there that can’t be overlooked, but thank you.]

With a feeling somewhere between gratitude and bitterness, Subaru thanked Ram, who had interjected.

Subaru felt that this was a restraint placed from Ram’s side. At the same time, it was an indication that Ram intended to be fair in this conversation and would not emotionally side with Rem.

Indeed, it was in line with the way that Rem used to often describe her assessment of Ram's behavior. 

Subaru: [Nee-sama, is far too kind…huh?]

Whether those words murmured within his mouth were heard or not, Ram, without saying anything, sniffed a little, then crossed her slender legs and brought her cup of tea to her lips. 

Beside her, Tanza, who seemed somewhat out of place, also looked at Subaru with her dark eyes.

Tanza: [Like Ram-sama, I also shall not favor Schwartz-sama. I am unable to gauge the situation, and if you have the impression that I will take your side, please do not misunderstand.]

Subaru: [I get it, Tanza is being properly strict with me. I didn’t think you’d take my side anyway.]

Tanza: [――――]

Subaru: [Huh? You seem a little upset? Why?]

This expression from Tanza, who had followed Ram’s lead and declared her impartiality, became a bit sulky. 

Tanza's expression rarely changed, but this sullen face was relatively common. Mostly, it popped up in response to Cecilus’s ridiculous words and actions, or when Hiain said too much. 

Also, it was directed toward Subaru with a high frequency. 

Nevertheless, thanks to Ram and Tanza’a statements of their positions, their mindset had been ascertained. 

With that, Subaru once again faced Rem and Louis, the two people who were his main focus. 

And then――,

Subaru: [Louis, we’re about to discuss something important. It’s about what I feel about you in my heart of hearts, no holds barred. Will you listen without running away?]

Louis: […Aau!]

Subaru: [Right, good girl. Thank you.]

After a moment of hesitation, Louis nodded with encouragement in her voice. 

That reaction was proof that she had a good understanding of what Subaru and the others around her were talking about. Rem, with anxiety in her eyes, peeked at Louis's profile.

In that expression, Rem was hoping to see the emotions she desired; if Louis would show even the slightest sign of discomfort, she would use that as a reason to stop the conversation.

But, in Louis’s profile, she could not find a reason to do so.

Subaru: [Rem, Louis, I think both of you have realized. That, in the beginning, I was really wary of Louis, that I always kept her at a distance… and that I truly hated her.]

Rem and Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [The reason for Rem being so extremely suspicious of me at first; that was the main cause. Somehow, wanting to separate the two of us, you even broke my fingers.]

Rem: [About that time… I, also, had gone too far.]

Subaru: [It’s fine. Looking back, it’s just another good memory between me and Rem.]

Rem: [Huh?]

Subaru flexed the fingers of his left hand as he answered, and Rem made a face as if doubting his sanity. Not only Rem, but Ram and also Tanza made the same face, and although the subject was his broken fingers, before his heart could be broken, Subaru changed the subject by saying, "Anyway”.

Subaru: [I was very, very wary of Louis. And so, Rem was very, very suspicious of me. I don’t know how Louis was feeling, but you must have felt that tense atmosphere, right?] 

Louis: [Uu?]

Subaru: [Even after we got separated at one point and later were reunited with everyone at the Shudraq village, even after we ran away from Guaral, even before and even after the battle for the siege of Guaral, it was always like that.]

Because of that, more and more, the gap between Subaru and Rem kept widening, and it became a hard chasm to fill.

As for the reasons, Subaru felt hatred for Louis, the fact that her existence invited a worsening of relations with Rem was something that undoubtedly had a great influence.

At the Demon City of Chaosflame, while they were separated from Rem, events occurred that caused his animosity toward Louis to change.

While spending time with Louis without Rem as a mediator, she had worked her hardest to protect Subaru, and gradually, gradually, Subaru had no choice but to admit it.

That was why he was honestly happy that Louis was there when he was reunited with Beatrice again in the Imperial Capital after they had gotten separated at the Demon City. None of the animosity that he had from the beginning lingered.

Subaru: [I think it would have been too easy to just keep on going without thinking too much about it. But, that's just not possible. It’s like a wound. Some wounds will heal if left alone, while others will only get worse. This is a wound that shouldn't be left untreated.]

In order for the wound to be healed, it must be treated.

And, for the treatment, one cannot rely on magic or medicine, but instead more daring methods.

This was a wound of the sort where that must be done.

Therefore――,

Subaru: [Up to now, I have never once said it. The reason, why I hated Louis.]

Louis: [Uau…]

Looking into those blue eyes, Subaru poured out his feelings.

Seeming to respond to Subaru's serious gaze and tone of voice, Louis did not turn away from him, either. This girl was ready to accept whatever was said.

Instead――,

Rem: [...Please stop.]

It was Rem who bit her lip in frustration and spoke in such a trembling voice.

She pleaded in a trembling voice while holding Louis's hand. ――No, that is not entirely correct. Not exactly. She was not holding Louis’s hand.

Rem’s hand. It was Rem’s hand that was being held by Louis, that much was clear.

Rem: [I don’t want to hear it. The reason that you hated Louis-chan is not worth worrying about. It’s fine if you were just being cold-hearted.]

Weakly shaking her head in refusal, Rem rejected Subaru’s words.

Avoiding putting pressure on Louis's hand by instead clenching her other hand so tightly that her bones creaked, Rem tried to refuse to go further.

He wanted to respect Rem’s feelings. He wanted to fulfill all of Rem’s wishes.

Subaru: [Sorry. Even you can’t plug your ears on this matter.]

But, it was no use.

He could not respect or grant Rem’s wishes.

If she truly did not want to listen, her only option was to flee that room. Subaru had no right to stop Rem if she really wanted to do that.

However, Rem also was aware of that.

Turning a deaf ear to Subaru's words here would be turning her back on her own missing Memories――,

Rem: [――――]

It also would mean betraying Ram’s feelings, who silently watched over her.

Rem: [Even so, I don’t want to… I don’t want to hear it…]

Clenching her eyes and gritting her teeth, Rem chose not to run away from this place.

However, she strongly, strongly rejected Subaru’s next words.

While struck by those very words, Subaru also did not take his eyes off of Louis.

Louis: [Uau.]

Louis's lips moved to make a sound; yes, an indefinite word.

He knew perfectly well that she was calling his name, “Subaru,” with those sounds.

He knew it, therefore.

Subaru: [Louis, the reason why I hated… why I detested you, was…]

Rem: [Stop…!!]

Subaru: [――Because you are the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, the one who stole Rem's Memories.]

――Because he understood, Subaru had to respond.

△▼△▼△▼△

At last, he finally said it, the words that he had been holding back.

At that moment, he told her; there was no sense of emotion of having revealed a secret, no heartbreaking sensation of condemnation of a detestable person.

What had remained was agony that intensified in weight and bitterness, even as he revealed what he had bottled up in his heart.
 
And, it intensified with the subsequent developments thereafter.

Rem: [Waaaaahhh――!]

Rem reached out her hand, raised her voice, and grimaced her face.

Her hand clutched Subaru's chest and pushed him down with tremendous force, and with no resistance on his part, she climbed on top of his body.

This would not have been possible even if he had not become smaller, but now that he was smaller, it was especially true.

If Rem had put real strength into her arms, Subaru's mouth easily would have been covered.

Yet, Rem did not do so until those decisive words were spoken.

And now, in this moment as she was mounted on Subaru, she spoke.

Rem: [Why… Why would you say that…?]

With her voice shaken, her face contorted with fury, she stared down upon Subaru's face at such a close distance that it took his breath away, but he made no attempt to use his arms to force her off.

Despite her outpouring of emotions, Rem was still rational in the end.

Subaru: [――――]

Feeling Rem's hot breath on his face, Subaru restrained the bystanders with his outstretched hand.

At the moment that Subaru was pushed down, Tanza immediately attempted to move to protect Subaru. However, he could see out of the corner of his eye that Ram was holding Tanza back by the arm.

From Subaru's end, he appealed to both of them that he was okay with it, and looked at Rem who was in front of him.

Tears streaked from Rem's pale, blue eyes and fell upon Subaru's cheeks.

It was neither anger nor sadness, but rather intense eyes of frustration and the last line of rationality that made her keep it. That was what was embodied in her tears.

That was――,

Rem: [I knew, even without you telling me, I… I knew that Louis-Chan had something to do with the Memories that I couldn't remember…!]

Subaru: [Rem…]

Rem: [Because there could be no other explanation. The only reason why you were so cruel to Louis-chan and tried to keep her away from me over and over again was because I would be in danger if I stayed with her…]

Rem emptied out her heart, her breath, her voice, her eyes, all of them trembling feebly.

Upon being told this, Subaru shut his eyes. It was only natural.

Indeed, Rem was the one who was the victim of these lost Memories.

There could be no way that Rem herself could be less concerned about her own Memories than Subaru and everyone else.

More than anyone else, she must have been in anguish, longing for the whereabouts of her own Memories.

Rem: [You think I don’t know… Do you think I'm stupid? Maybe I am stupid. I don't know anything. I'm a stupid woman. I don't even know anything about you! I don't even want to! And yet you just barge right in… I hate you!]

Subaru: [――――]

Rem: [You are nothing compared to Louis-chan. She has always been beside me and always cared for me… She is, Louis-chan, is my…]

Those endless streams of tears not only hit Subaru's cheeks, but they also ran down Rem's cheeks and chin, embellishing her body and heart with teardrops, disguising them.

He wanted to know, and hoped that he did not.

Rem: [Everything, all of it has to be some kind of mistake…  Everything, all of it is your lies…]

Subaru: [――Rem.]

Rem: [――oh.]

Weakly, Rem's eyes welled up with tears, and when a large teardrop fell, her blurred vision must have been temporarily cleared, for she could see Subaru's face right before her.

Subaru, though he was being pushed down, gently cupped Rem's face between his hands, and she fixed her gaze on him.

Black and blue eyes met, and Subaru spoke to her lovely tear-streaked face.

Subaru: [I'm not lying. Everything you thought, Rem, was true. Louis, is our enemy.]

Rem: [――Hk, what do you mean, "enemy"? Because of what she did to me, to my Memories? If so, then…!]

With a strong shake of her head, Rem raised herself up as she left Subaru's hands. As it was, she turned toward Louis, who remained standing in her initial position,

Rem: [Then, I will… I'll forgive Louis-Chan. I forgive her, so why can't you do that? See, that solves everything, doesn't it…?]

Subaru: [No, that's pointless. That, doesn't solve anything.]

Rem: [WHY!]

Subaru: [――Because I will never forgive Louis for the pain she caused you.]

And so Subaru declared to Rem, his voice cracking, that he would never forgive Louis.

At Subaru's words, Rem's eyes widened, and her breath was snatched away. Suddenly, the strength was drained from Rem's body, and Subaru slowly raised himself up.

Rem, still on top of Subaru's body, stood up and met him at close range.

Subaru: [It's not just me. It's Ram, it's everyone else, it's everyone who cares about you, Rem. They will never forgive Louis. No matter how much you say you forgive her.]

Rem: [That's, just…]

Subaru: [Besides, Rem… Louis didn't do what she did to just you. Many, many, more people are suffering from Gluttony's wrongdoings because of what Louis did.]

Even if Rem really forgave Louis, even if she forgave her out of compassion and not out of impetus, there were many more "Rems" in this world who could not forgive Louis.

Unless these people were saved, Rem's desperate plea would never come to fruition.

Rem: […Many, others?]

Subaru: [Yeah. It's staggering. So many people are suffering.]

Rem: [Well… Well, is there nothing that can be done about it?]

Subaru: [――――]

Rem: [From the very beginning, there was nothing that could be done about it, was there? Tell me that that's the kind of problem you're talking about… Is that what the resolution you were referring to was?]

Her lips trembled, and another large tear began to run down from Rem's eyes.

Or, rather than wallowing over her Memories, Rem wept for Louis.

Rem's lips trembled as she expressed her emotional desire to save Louis, to save her, no matter what had happened to her Memories. She wept.

Whether from her tears or her trembling voice, Subaru experienced the pain of being cut to pieces.

Subaru: [Sorry, this is a joke, right?]

Rem: […Please, don't apologize.]

Subaru: [But, I'm sorry. That's all I can say. It's been so hard and painful this whole time for you, Rem.]

Rem: [That's why I don't want you to apologize… I, I don't want to hear it…!]

Subaru: [I'm sorry, but you have to listen to me.]

Rem: [That’s why…!]

Subaru: [I don't want to give up. ――I don't want to keep on refusing to forgive Louis.]

Rem: [――Huh?]

A gasp escaped from Rem's throat, and her eyes widened.

Right in front of Rem, Subaru took in a deep breath and licked his lips. Each word, each thought, he made sure that they were conveyed to this girl and to the others who wanted to hear it.

Subaru: [I'm just like you, Rem. I want to forgive Louis. I don't want to continue being unable to forgive her. But I can't. Because, I care about you, Rem.]

Rem: [――Hk.]

Subaru: [This is why, why I can't forgive Louis for the terrible things that she did to you, for taking away your Memories, and for causing you to still suffer like this, Rem.]

Gently reaching out, Subaru wiped a tear from Rem's cheek with his finger.

When he wiped off that drop, many more teardrops awaited him, already on Rem's cheeks. Even so, Rem did not break Subaru's finger.

Subaru was not denied, so he continued his words.

Subaru: [Everybody was giving me a lot of crap about it. They scolded me a lot for thinking such stupid things. I think Otto still thinks it would be better if Louis were dead.]

But, that was surely the natural mindset.

This was not to say that it was a self-purification process, but everyone knew in their hearts that it had to happen. Even Subaru knew it in his mind, and that was why he strongly disagreed with them.

However――,

Subaru: [Julius told me. He's such an awesome guy. On the other hand, he might be an idiot. He's as much a victim as you are, Rem. But, you can't say something like that. Idiot.]

Rem: [――――]

Subaru: [I've been told a lot of things by smart people, by stupid people, by… cool people, by kind people, by amazing people, and I've thought about it a lot. I've thought about it a lot and decided. My common ground.]

Rem: [Common, ground…]

Subaru: [I want to believe in Louis. I want to forgive her… But, I can't forgive her right now.]

So, as he spoke his thoughts and watched Rem's eyes waver in front of him, Subaru's mind thought back to something a certain person had said to him.

???: [How could I go along with someone who decides who lives or dies based on his own fickle whims?]

The words of a man, with whom Natsuki Subaru was incompatible, clawed painfully at his soul.

He was told that a fickle attitude of preference, of deciding life or death, was not something worthy of trust.

Subaru was sure that those words were right. It was Subaru's very heart that was the most untrustworthy.

Still, it was a matter of coming to terms with his heart, something that he could not yield to anyone else.

Reconciling with his fragile and pathetic soul, so easily bonded and so ready to flip-flop.

Rem: [――Ah.]

Surprised by his words, Subaru hugged Rem tightly, unable to move.

Despite the difference in height, Subaru pulled himself out from under her body and hugged Rem's slumped head to his stomach.

Subaru wanted to convey that he truly cared about Rem from the bottom of his heart.

And then――,

Louis: [――Uau.]

At the sound of that voice calling his name, Subaru looked at Louis.

Louis, who had let go of Rem's hand and stood there, knowing that it was her turn, had called out to Subaru.

Louis: [Uu…]

Louis stood there looking lonely. Rem, who was being hugged by Subaru, let out an "ah" and hurriedly stood up.

Then Rem, hugging Louis from in front of her,

Rem: [S-sorry, Louis-chan… We, it just happened on its own…]

Louis: [Au, Uau, aaau.]

Rem: [I, I'm sorry…]

With a feeble apology, Rem wiped her face with her sleeve and stood beside Louis.

Also, squeezing Louis's hand tightly, but not leaning her face in closely. Yes, to Louis, who had moved Rem's heart, there was a little bit of envy once again.

In addition to that――,

Subaru: [――Louis, do you still want to be with me?]

Louis: […U?]

Rem: […What, what do you mean?]

The two of them tilted their heads together as if they did not understand the meaning of Subaru's question.
 
They both tilted their heads, not only Rem, but also Louis. ――But also, "Louis".

Subaru: [As I told you earlier, Rem.. Even if you forgive Louis, I will not forgive her. The many other victims of Gluttony will not forgive Louis, either. But.]

Rem: […But?]

Subaru: [But, Louis, I want to forgive you. If I could, I would. So, let me ask you this.]

Firmly, consciously not letting his voice waver, Subaru looked straight at Louis.

He saw Rem squeeze Louis's hand, and Louis squeezed it back. It was the hope that this would be the answer to their relationship.

Subaru: [Are you a Sin Archbishop? Or, is it just a possibility?]

Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [I've been told a lot. And, I agree. The world cannot and should not forgive a Sin Archbishop, and the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb, should not be allowed to exist.]

Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [But, you saved me. You protected me over and over again. I don't even know what I wanted it to be for myself. You're nothing like the Louis Arneb that I knew. Still, you can use the Authority of Gluttony. You have the Witch Factor.]

That was Subaru's full impression of "Louis" from his time so far.

She had the same appearance as the Sin Archbishop, Louis Arneb, whom he had encountered in the Corridor of Memories, and even though she possessed the same Authority as Louis Arneb, she did not seem to be the same person.

It was just like "Natsuki Subaru" from some time ago, and "Rem", who was like this now.

Things that were the same, yet different.

Things that could be the same or different; choices according to one's own will.

To ask "Louis", as such.

Subaru: [Are you the Sin Archbishop that no one in this world can ever forgive? Or, is there a possibility that you might be able to undo what you have done as a Sin Archbishop?]

Louis: [A, uu…]

Subaru: [Can… can you, live your life anew?]

What, what if.

What if the situation that "Louis" was currently in was the same as that of "Natsuki Subaru" and "Rem"? Then, what Subaru was asking was a terribly cruel and unreasonable question. 

Subaru already knew the pain of being overwhelmed by the debt of a person whom he did not remember. Rem knew it as well.

And now, the same thing was about to be put upon Louis, as well.

However――,

Subaru: [If you can do that, if you want that, then take my hand.]

As he said this, Subaru slowly extended his hand to Louis.

Louis's eyes traced back and forth between Subaru's face and the proffered hand; similarly, Rem, who held her breath next to the girl, traced Subaru's eyes and hand with her gaze.

Subaru: [Louis, a lot of people curse you the same way that I do. I can't speak for all of them. But, just for one.]

Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [I don't know what you need to do to get other people to forgive you. It's just… just that I can only tell you what you need to do for me to forgive you.]

Before he had come here, before letting him have this time, Emilia said.

She said that Subaru had taught her, but that was not quite true. Subaru was always learning from everyone else.

He did not even know how to resolve his own feelings without being told how to do it.

Then, why did Subaru even want to forgive Louis?

How could Subaru forgive Louis for all of this?

The way to reach that, to reach a place of compromise, was――,

Subaru: [――Louis, save lots of people.]

Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [Now, you're facing an unreasonable situation. I know that you may be facing a ridiculously unreasonable cross to bear for something that you have no memory of. But, still.]

He took a big breath, looked at Louis with unwavering eyes, and told her.

Subaru: [Help lots of people.]

Louis: [――――]

Subaru: [If you help, help, and keep helping more than you stole… at least I, and I alone, will be on your side.]

――The things you’ve done in the past won’t disappear.

That was what Anastasia had said just before, a statement that froze Subaru in his tracks.

Even Subaru's Return by Death had taught him that some things could never be overturned, advice that Subaru now considered to be traumatic.

However, when Anastasia had made that statement, she also said,

Anastasia: [If you want people to believe you're doing the right thing, you have to show them something worthwhile. The only way to change their appraisal is to overturn it with a different one.]

That was the most important part of the traumatic advice that Subaru had received.

Subaru offered his hand to Louis like this now because her actions had overturned the bad impressions that Subaru had.

This change of heart that happened to Subaru would be experienced by all the people affected by Gluttony.

That was――,

Subaru: [――That's what I can offer you, a start from zero.]

Not just from zero, but a negative start must be made on a worldwide scale.

It was such a delusional, tremendous, far-reaching, and wildly difficult task. Who could believe that it could be achieved?

But, that was all that Subaru could offer.

And, if it was such a delusional, tremendous, far-reaching, and wildly difficult task that no one could believe that it could be done, Subaru would help.

The same way that it had been done for Natsuki Subaru in the past.

Louis: [――――]

Hand outstretched, Subaru remained still, and waited for the answer to come.

There was no rush. Nor could he wait forever. She took the time that she needed, as much time as she needed, and he just waited patiently for the needed answer.

Rem: [I, I don't know about this…]

In that silence, beside the silent Subaru and Louis, Rem whispered.

For but a moment, it seemed as if that statement meant that Subaru's proposal would not be heard. But, Rem's eyes said otherwise.

She continued.

Rem: [This Sin Archbishop thing, this Louis Arneb name, all of it.]

Subaru: [――――]

Rem: [But, if this Sin Archbishop thing and this Louis Arneb person are not allowed to exist in this world… what will this child become?]

Her voice trembled. But, her pale blue eyes were not filled with tears.

Rem's eyes were direct, as if to say that she could not see the answer she needed, nor the answer the other person offered, with her blurred and moist vision.

If she chose to be neither a Sin Archbishop nor Louis Arneb, who or what would she be?

As "Louis", she would bear the burden of many unreasonable things and walk the path to seek forgiveness, not knowing if it would exist on the other side of it all. ――Who would such a girl become?

When proffered this question, all that Subaru could say was――,

Subaru: [――Spica.]

Rem: [What…?]

Subaru: [I give this name to this girl who will live a new way of life and a new self.]

Rem's eyes widened, and so did Louis's.

Subaru intended to do everything that he could to help her choose a different way of life and a completely different future.

Because, in a world where no one would forgive a Sin Archbishop, in a world where no one would forgive Louis Arneb, he nevertheless sincerely wanted to forgive the girl who stood in front of him.

Because Subaru wished for the girl to be something like that, so that he could forgive her――.

Rem: [Spica…]

Stunned, dumbfounded, Rem's eyes looked to the side as she uttered the name.

The little girl stared at Subaru, who in turn looked at her without averting his eyes.

Such was his wish, for it to happen.

If he spoke it out loud, surely the girl would do so. Yet, Subaru would not speak because he respected her wishes, not his own. 

Because he wanted her to choose it for herself, not for someone else.

He wanted her to walk and walk and keep walking, so that when she looked back at the path after she had walked it, she would be able to see that it was a path that she had chosen and walked along.

Louis: [――Uau.]

Subaru: [――――]

The little girl's thin lips moved. Subaru's name was called softly.

Subaru remained still and silent, and waited. Subaru did not want to rush. Nor did he want to wait forever. Subaru wanted to hear the answer, her having taken the necessary time and chosen what she needed.

Then, the girl's expression changed, as Subaru struggled to contain himself.

Louis: [Auuau.]

Loose and tender, words were spun, and a smile floated.

Then, tears trickled down from her blue eyes, and the girl's hand gently grasped Subaru's proffered hand.

Subaru welcomed the gentle, soft touch, his eyes squeezed shut.

A new way of life, not a Sin Archbishop nor a Louis Arneb.

A past that could not be erased, a Sin Archbishop, and Louis Arneb.

The girl who would have to walk down the thorny path―― "Spica", held his hand tightly so as not to let go.

Subaru: [I want to forgive you someday. ――So, let's do it together.]

Spica: […Au!]

Spica grinned with a tearful look, showing her white teeth.

Rem, who had been looking at Spica's smile from the side, her emotions swelled and burst forth.

Rem: [――Hk.]

Rem embraced Spica with more passion and many more tears than ever before.

Hugging, cradling, and whimpering, Rem cried out. Spica's expression clouded and scrunched up as she was startled by Rem's embrace,

Spica: [――Aaaau!]

Spica, too, burst into tears, loudly, her face crumpled, as she shouldered a fate that was not quite fitting for her age.

Just like every new being born into this world did.

The girls kept crying, wailing like newborn babies. They kept crying.
