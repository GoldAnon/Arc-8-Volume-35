*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

The more it is needed, this is an unprecedented situation grows in certainty.

In the history books describing events that once took place in Lugunica, a case similar to this unusual situation was recorded, but in the sequence of events, the case was not treated as a major detail.

――The Demi-Human War

In the past, Lugunica had a massive civil war, and, like the present situation, the dead rose as enemies in the only precedent known in history.

However, the main focus of the history book was more on the friction between the human and demi-human tribes, and the extraordinary attacks carried out as part of the civil war had not been recorded.

That is regrettable. If the details of that time had been noted in more depth ――,

Garfiel: [I'm not going to fall behind these people!]

With a roar, a fist is swung, and a group of pale-skinned imperial soldiers together are blown away.

The blow, which was more like a cleave than a punch, was unleashed with the vitality that had been drawn up from the earth they stood on with full force.

Continuing like that twice, three more times, the attack repeated, each time knocking out the enemy's formation. ――No, it was not so great as a formation.

At first glance, the silhouettes of the enemy approached side by side, however, there was no such thing as tactical leadership, coordination, or strategy. If that is the case, it is simply a cluster of individuals.

If they are a bunch of individuals, Garfiel would not be caught lagging behind.

However――,

Garfiel: [Zuh-ah! Zua!]

With a sharp lunge, a double slash grazes Garfiel's neck.

He glared at his opponent with the sensation of his hair standing on end, and then kicked off a piece of the crushed Undead and jumped into the air, but instead of another Undead, it was one that was clothed in a different air.

Garfiel: [Tsk.]

He raised his shoulder with a cluck of his tongue and checked his neck, where the tip of the sword slightly grazed.

The extent of the slash was about a finger's length different between the first and second cuts. It is the technique of a master who dares to demonstrate a dodgeable blow, and then tries to cut off the opponent's head with a second.

It was nothing but a mass of individuals without any formation, but occasionally among them, there were those who had this kind of previous ability.

As a result, it had become a bit more difficult than expected, and it is assumed that there is one skilled person out of every twenty. Because of this, he cannot carelessly support his allies by saying that they will be fine as long as they are working together.

One assessment of the situation means that a formation of a hundred men could be destroyed by a single skilled one.

Garfiel: [Zuh-ah! Zua——!]

Garfiel wrinkles his nose, whereupon the undead again unleashed the same two swords.

The range of their technique changed more boldly, just as it had been shown once before. Earlier, it was a fingertip's worth, and now it is a fist's worth. A deep cut the size of a fist would be fatal, no matter how shallow the cut was.

However, the undead who released the technique had a look in his eyes that was in stark contrast to the certainty of victory.

The reason was simple ——his opponent's right arm, the one holding a sword, had been shattered at the wrist.

Garfiel: [No matter how many tricks you play, the position of your grip on the sword that extends remains the same. "The three-headed Valgren has but one… body"!]

He turns his left hand, which shattered its wrist, and his fist is immediately thrust into the face of his stunned opponent.

As soon as the impact of the blow passed through to the back of its head, the Undead's head exploded as if it were a burst fruit. As the head disintegrated, the cracks went through the torso and legs, and the whole body shattered.

Garfiel: [I don't like this.]

Looking down at the debris of his vanquished foe, Garfiel spat.

What irritated Garfiel was the way the undead were defeated and destroyed. Since they were dead, it would not be appropriate to describe them as dying, and more than anything else, the way they shattered deprived Garfiel of the feeling that he was fighting against something that had life.

All that remained was a nagging sense of what he was fighting against.

Garfiel: [————]

Garfiel wiped the sweat from his chin with his arm, and if he looked around, he would see an incessant stream of undead soldiers on the night plains that had become the battlefield.

In order to combat them, a tactical delaying force, including Garfiel, continued to fight hard.

Initially, Garfiel had been assigned to a healing unit that utilized healing magic, but the policy of not letting anyone get injured suited Garfiel's nature better than treating the injured.

Petra: [Garf-san, your fidgeting is worrisome! If you're so restless, go help the people fighting yourself.]

Said Petra, who was struggling in the same treatment unit as Garfiel.

Not at her insistence, but Garfiel rushed out. In fact, as a volunteer, he thought, he did as well as could be expected.

However, he could not boast that he was doing his best work.

Because——,

???: [Do it——!]

A sharp yell pierced the black of the night, immediately after which the sound of drawn bowstrings firing rang out in succession.

In accordance with the yell of Taritta, the chieftain of the People of Shudraq, a tremendously dense hail of arrows was fired.

Rather than as individual arrows, the arrows fell as a single cluster without any means to dodge,
the only way to evade them being to either receive or repel all of them. In fact, the undead, having no choice but to suffer the attack, each tried to utilize their weapons and shields.

However——,

???(Kuna?): [I see it!]

???(Holly): [I’ll go for it!]

With the undead focused on the sky overhead, an assertive voice fired their heavy bow.

Literally, to say that they were shot through would be a lukewarm expression, like being hit with the absurd shock of a full speed dragon carriage, the defensive positions of the undead received it, and blew away the group behind them at the same time.

Garfiel: [My amazin’ self ain’t s’pposed to lose to ya, but that’s crazy.]

Under the rain of arrows the weaker undead were eradicated, and the strong undead which survived this attack were sniped by the heavy bow. The hunting rhythm of the coordinated hunters greatly impressed Garfiel.

Even Garfiel’s movements would be sealed if he was filled with arrows like a hedgehog, and then in addition to that was the huge damage of the strong bow which could not be dodged. It was a relief to have those tactics on their side.

Garfiel: [Well, ov’r there’s also ridiculous…]

Despite the great strength of the Shudraq, another group won Garfiel’s admiration in a different way—— accompanying Subaru who had fought alone in the Empire, a group who all looked rough, the self-proclaimed Pleiades Battalion.

Pleiades: [WE WILL DO IT, WE WILL DO IT, WE WILL DO IT, WE WILL DO IT――!]

Pleiades: [STRONGEST! INVINCIBLE! SUPERIOR! SUPERIOR!]

Pleiades: [UOOOO――!]

And, with them also being abnormally loud for a nighttime battle, and with no one who Garfiel’s eye could see as being exceptionally skilled in martial prowess. Of course, many of them seemed to have learned their techniques to the level of an Imperial Soldier, but even so.

It was hard to say that the majority of them had been polished, and they were good at giving into their instincts and acted with violence.

But even so, they were strong. Already, the difference in physical strength was no longer like that between an adult and a child.

???: [It’s beautiful. Their strength is refreshing.]

The way that the Pleiades Battalion fought, as Garfiel stared at them a voice reached him. Before he could turn around, lined up next to him was a woman with dark brown skin and dyed red hair―― Mizelda.

Mizelda, who had a single wooden leg, wore a smile the color of blood while looking at the violent fighting of the Battalion.

Garfiel: [I don’t understand whatcha mean, but they’re the ones that rescued Captain. I dunno what they’re doin’ either, but I ain’t worried that they’re in trouble.]

Mizelda: [Captain… Subaru. Emilia and the others, they put great faith in you.]

Garfiel: [Ha! Faith? A word like that ain’t enough for it. Captain’s a man, a man who gives back my amazin’ self’s expectations and faith a hundred times ov’r!]

It was neither an exaggeration nor a bluff, from the bottom of his heart Garfiel zero doubt in praising him in such a way. At Garfiel’s answer, the quality of Mizelda’s smile changed.

From a mask of war, to something that was somehow calmer and harbored a sense of understanding.

Mizelda: [I too understand that feeling. In Subaru’s Lifeblood Ritual too, and the battles that followed it he proved himself to us. He has the soul of a warrior. Though he may not have a good face for a man, he’d make a good husband for Taritta.]

Garfiel: [Don’t talk about his face! The Captain also worries about tha look in his eyes! And…]

Mizelda: [And?]

Garfiel: [No matter how much you’ve been charmed by Captain, there’s someone that he’s already fallen for without fail.]

Mizelda: [――I see. That’s right.]

Garfiel rubbed his nose with his finger, and Mizelda nodded sincerely.

To what extent what she had said was a joke, and to what extent it had been pure praise he was unsure of, but the fact that Subaru was also valued within this Empire made Garfiel proud.

Wherever he was, Subaru always involved the people around him and brought about great results.

However, though they believed that Subaru could get on exceedingly well wherever he found himself, it was the wish of Garfiel and the collective will of the entire Camp that he stayed with them.

It was for this reason they had come to the Empire, that everyone had rushed across that dangerous bridge.

Garfiel: [But then, there were a lotta obstacles that got in the way of reunitin’ our amazin’ selves with the Captain.]

Garfiel was a military officer, one who loved to compete against the strong. But, he was not a battle junkie who chose to fight anyone and everyone, no matter the time or place.

To reunite with an important companion, obstacles constantly appearing as if there was no end to the adversaries to that joyful reunion, such a thing was not joyful but instead filled his heart with hatred.

Garfiel: [But, they sure are an incomprehensible lot, aren’t they?]

Mizelda: [The dead coming back to life is unnatural. I understand what you’re saying…]

Garfiel: [Ah, that ain’t what I meant.]

Mizelda: [――?]

His teeth creaked as he bit them together, as Mizelda raised an eyebrow at Garfiel’s mutter.

In response to her doubt, Garfiel jerked his chin, directing his gaze towards a group of undead that were still being targeted by the Shudraq's arrows.

Garfiel: [Look closely and you’ll get it… All of ‘em don’t take damage in the same way. Some break with one arrow, while others don’t, even with five arrows in ‘em.]

Mizelda: [Beasts can be stubborn. People are too. Isn't it the same thing?]

Garfiel: [The difference between strong 'n weak, that I know. This ain’t like that…]

He could not explain it well, but even among the undead that looked roughly equal in strength to Garfiel’s eyes, he sensed a difference in resilience.

Whether an arrow hit a vital spot or not seemed to have little relevance. Some seemed to be unaffected even with an arrow piercing an eye, while others shattered from a single arrow lodged in their shoulder.

It felt as if this difference could not be measured solely by the strength or weakness of their life force——.

Garfiel: [Damn it! Jus thinkin’ ‘bout it hurts my head! It’s “A Guiltilaw that fell one step short.” Let’s jus’ crush ‘em all, I can’t do much else anyway…]

Roswaal: [——That thought is exactly like “A Guiltilaw that fell one step short,” iiisn’t~ it?]

At that moment, Garfiel's shoulders jolted in response to the voice that came from above.

When he hastily looked up, there was a silhouette gradually approaching from the thickly clouded night sky. It rapidly grew into the appearance of a man that Garfiel hated.

And then——,

Roswaal: [You are working hard, so let me trouble you some mooore~.]

Garfiel: [Damn you, Dudley…]

Roswaal: [Oops. I feel bad saying this after you had finally gotten used to my alias, but after the meeting we had earlier, there's no longer a need to hide my naaame~. So, as usual, you can…]

Garfiel: [Shitty Roswaal!]

Roswaal: [While there is an unnecessary prefix, but you can call me that, I don’t miiind~.]

Indeed, Roswaal, who had landed on the ground, was laughing, provoking Garfiel's irritation.

Since infiltrating into Vollachia, his facial makeup and outlandish costumes had ceased, but his unique manner of speaking, which should have been sealed as well, had returned.

Hearing that the pseudonym was also lifted, it could be inferred that the discussion in the dragon carriage had probably been settled.

The negotiations that Otto, Frederica, and the others had mentioned before, to reach a consensus regarding their involvement with the Empire—— without twisting Subaru and Emilia’s feelings.

That in itself was a joyous thing for Garfiel.

Garfiel: [If the talkin’s done, I'd like to hear what happened… Beatrice! Have ya changed sides? It's unusual for ya to be with that bastard Roswaal.]

Beatrice: [It’s out of necessity, in fact. If possible, Betty would rather not leave Subaru's side for even a second, I suppose. But, it can't be helped that they've asked for help, in fact.]

With that said, Beatrice flung herself out of Roswaal's arms.

Since about a month ago, Beatrice had been active even in Subaru’s absence. The memory was fresh, and now that she somehow managed to reunite with Subaru, Garfiel thought that she would have resolved never to leave Subaru’s side again. 

In fact, just before everyone was about to smother the awoken Subaru in the coupled dragon carriage, the girl had been mumbling along those lines with a completely determined look in her eyes.

That girl had left Subaru’s side, and had come to the battlefield with Roswaal——,

Beatrice: [Garfiel, about the unease you also feel, its source will be identified, I suppose]

Garfiel: [The source, of the unease?]

Roswaal: [If you go into a battle without knowing your enemy, the results will be less than even half of what you expected. The way to compensate is to know your enemy. Especially this enemy, who is shrouded in faaar~ too many mysteries.]

Having been left by Beatrice, who he had just been holding, Roswaal swung his arms as if feeling a bit lonely. At the words of those two, Garfiel felt satisfied with the outcome of the conversation, and his fighting spirit surged. 

Even though the hated Roswaal was the messenger who brought it.

Mizelda: [Not Dudley, but Roswaal… That's your real name then?]

Roswaal: [Yes, Miss Mizelda. Due to certain reasons, I had to falsify my name. I do apologize. Not only I, but also Emilia-sama, who you knew as Emily, had to do the saaame~.]

Mizelda: [It was done by a man with a nice face. I will forgive.]

Beatrice: [What an absurd standard, in fact…]

Mizelda digested the issue of the pseudonyms with her own peculiar sense of values.

Beside her, Garfiel looked at Roswaal and Beatrice,

Garfiel: [So, the fight'll continue in the Empire, and you two are coming with…]

Beatrice: [Events outside the realm of reason are best identified by magicians who have the ability to interfere with reason, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [This is a historic collaboration between Lugunica and Vollachia. The most valuable thing the Kingdom can offer in return to them is a magical approooach~ to finding the cause.]

If the knowledge of a mage could help to identify the cause of the endless stream of undead, then surely there was no one in Emilia's camp better qualified to help than Roswaal and Beatrice.

Emilia was a Spiritual Arts User, Ram was the type to rely on her senses, and Petra was still in the process of learning.

Roswaal: [How did it feel to actually fight an extended battle? What have you learned?]

Garfiel: [――. I don't really get the difference between someone who's easy to beat 'n someone who's hard to beat. I think there's a reason apart from bein' strong or weak…]

Roswaal: [Hmm.The difference between survivability and the vitality of each individual?]

Garfiel inwardly clicked his tongue at Roswaal, who was in thought with a long, slender finger on his chin.

It was true that he did not like Roswaal's every move, but the tongue click just now was not due to irritation with him, but rather for the fact that he was counting on his thoughts and knowledge.

Because, he honestly thought that Roswaal was reliable in this situation.

Beatrice: [Roswaal, looking at it in a daze won't lead to the answer, in fact.]

Roswaal: [Agreed. Well then… Beatrice, how much mana do you have left?]

Beatrice: [After having met with Subaru, everything is perfect, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [Fair enough. Theeen~――]

Roswaal smiled, his heterochromatic eyes narrowed, and soon after, four different colored lights, mana, floated in the air around him.

Roswaal snapped his fingers, and the four colored lights raced through the darkness of the night at arrow-like speeds, piercing into the distant group of undead, each light displaying their own powers.

One of the Undead was set ablaze, and another was encased in ice. One had its limbs severed by a blade of wind, and one was pierced through the groin by a block of rock that rose up from the ground.

All of them were fatal wounds, a destructive force that shattered them into pieces with a cracking sound a moment later. Garfiel, and even Mizelda, raised their eyebrows slightly in surprise at the result.

Roswaal: [As it was reported, it's the fire attribute that works the most effeeectively~. Wind doesn't penetrate well, and earth is handled no differently than a strike. Freezing seems to be very inefficient.]

However, to Roswaal, the executor of the attack, it was not the fact that the Undead were defeated, but rather how the strength of the attacks affected the defeated Undead.

And then, Beatrice had also begun the same examination, but in a different way than Roswaal.

Beatrice: [――Vita.]

Beatrice held her hand up to the night sky, and her chanted magic meddled with the rain of arrows, which was released by the People of Shudraq, as the arrows tore through the sky.

Innumerable arrows, aimed at the Undead, poured down upon the enemy, their weight multiplied several times by the effects of Beatrice's Yin magic―― magic that altered the weight of its target.

The increase in their power could be gauged from the spectacular sound that came from each Undead as they were pierced into the ground.

Beatrice: [As Garfiel said, there is no explanation for why some zombies crumble, and others don't, even though the arrows are of different weights and have different power, in fact.]

Garfiel: [If ya make all the arrows heavier, won't it be hard to tell the difference?]

Beatrice: [Don't think so lowly of Betty, I suppose. Instead of making all of the arrows the same weight, each arrow was tested with a different one, in fact.]

Beatrice appeared angry, puffing out her cheeks like a little girl, but her reply in an effort to not look like a fool was even more foolish.

Garfiel, as a person who could use magic, albeit specializing in healing magic, understood the precision of the magical manipulation that Beatrice was doing.

One could see that what she had just done with magic was of equal difficulty to threading many needles at once without using one's hands.

Moreover, Beatrice and Roswaal were――, 

Roswaal: [The cause of their crumbling is not the loss of their liiimbs~. Some of them are still alive even after having their vitals gouged out. Although they are humanoid in appearance, it is better not to think of them as living creeeatures~.]

Beatrice: [It's not easy for anyone other than you to treat them like they're not living creatures when they're laughing, angry, and even talking, I suppose. ――Maybe it's contingent on the accumulation of a certain amount of damage, in fact.]

Roswaal: [That's quite an insulting assessment. I've spent a lot of time with all of you, and I think I've regained a lot of my humaaanity~. Some of them can be taken down with just one leg blown off. If it's a condition of damage accumulation, it doesn't add uuup~.]

Beatrice: [It's a ridiculous argument to dismiss it as a simple difference in individual endurance, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [What other reason could there be? The flow of mana is even.]

Beatrice: [Of course, it’s even… Wait, in fact. It's way too even, I suppose.]

While exchanging banter with each other, Roswaal and Beatrice's examination of the enemy progressed.

Surprisingly, the two of them checked the nature of the Undead who attacked them, using their respective areas of magical expertise as they did so.

Fire, wind, and purple arrows raged, and the Undead were unable to get close to the two as they fought side by side.

Of course, Garfiel and Mizelda also attacked the undead to keep them away, but even without them, Roswaal and Beatrice would not be deterred.
 
Although he wouldn’t say it since Beatrice would absolutely hate it――,

Mizelda: [Those two couldn't be more in sync.]

Garfiel: [We absolutely can’t let them hear that.]

As with Garfiel’s thoughts, Mizelda gave the exact same assessment.
 
While showing off coordination that could only be described like that, Beatrice, unaware of what they were thinking, lowered her eyebrows and called out "Roswaal!"

Beatrice: [Going to approach them just once, in fact.]

Roswaal: [――What a reckless thing to say.]

After saying this, Beatrice lightly kicked the ground with her foot and jumped forward.
 
With a flutter of the hem of her dress, Beatrice's small body soared like a feather. This was also an unnatural jump, her own weight eliminated by using Yin magic.
 
As it was, Beatrice was headed for a single undead who had its back to her ――sensing Beatrice's approach, it turned around to face her.

Roswaal: [Jiwald.]

A moment later, the undead's right hand that held a sword was vaporized as it was about to strike Beatrice with it.
 
Roswaal was pointing at the undead. A white light that had emitted from his fingertip had burned the opponent's arm. The undead was stiffened in astonishment, and Beatrice placed her hand on its forehead.
 
Then Beatrice's distinctive patterned eyes widened,

Beatrice: [As expected, I suppose.]

Beatrice grumbled as her body was pulled away by an arm around her slender waist.
 
Holding Beatrice's body close, Roswaal exchanged places with her and delivered a sharp fist with the arm opposite the one holding her, shattering the undead's head before it could regain its composure.

Roswaal: [Good grief, I'm the one who is going to get scolded by Subaru-kun.]

Beatrice: [And it's Betty who will get all the praise from Subaru, in fact. ――It’s Restoration Magic, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [――So that is why.]

Roswaal, who had complained about Beatrice's recklessness, closed his yellow eye at what he was told instead of an apology.
 
The current interaction with the undead gave Beatrice some kind of certainty. It seemed that Roswaal understood this in a few words, but unfortunately, Garfiel had no clue what it meant.

Garfiel: [Oi, I don't understand at all! Explain it in a way that even Emilia-sama could understand!]

Beatrice: [Essentially, Emilia and Garfiel are about the same in terms of their comprehension, in fact. ――Now we know the structure of the zombies' bodies and the mechanism behind it, I suppose.]

Garfiel: [That’s why I'm asking ya, what's that all about?]

Garfiel asked the question with gnashed teeth.
 
Garfiel was already aware of the existence of Restoration Magic. It was a magic that could restore damaged objects, and he heard that the best users could even restore burned books from ashes.
 
However, it was said that there were few users, and that there were also noticeable shortcomings, such as the need for exquisite magical precision and the tendency for restored items to deteriorate in quality.
 
And above all, life could never be restored. ――This was not restoration nor repair, but the forbidden realm of something like the Sacrament of the Immortal King that had been brought up a few times already.

Roswaal: [Teacher chose mana for her vessel, and I chose blood for mine. ――But this enemy chose earth for theirs, and they are not bothered by letting their contents overflow?]

Roswaal, covering his mouth, spoke of the revelation that Beatrice had given him.
 
Even then, Garfiel's understanding fell short of theirs, but he could intuit that it was a path that would lead to answers that were terribly disturbing and unpleasant even for Garfiel.
 
Disregarding Garfiel, Roswaal looked at Beatrice with a grim expression on his face.

Roswaal: [Beatrice, this isn't the Sacrament of the Immortal King, right?]

Beatrice: [...The basis is the same, but the approach is different, in fact. Sacrament of the Immortal King treats the vessel first, and the soul second, I suppose. However, as for these zombies,]

Roswaal: [The soul comes first; the vessel comes after. ――The body changes form to suit the soul.]

At Roswaal's comment, Beatrice nodded deeply.
 
As usual, Garfiel could not understand the crucial part of the exchange between the two. Garfiel, holding back his bitterness, suddenly could not believe his eyes.

Garfiel: [――――]

Roswaal was there with an expression that reflected even more anguish on his face than Garfiel did.
 
He had never imagined he could have this contorted expression on his face. ――Nay, Garfiel had hoped to punch him in the stomach someday, wanting to bring about an anguished face, but for a reason unrelated to Garfiel's desire, Roswaal was in agony.

With that agony reflected in his eyes, Roswaal opened his mouth.

Roswaal: [I think I might know who this “enemy” is.]

Garfiel : [—— Eh, for real?! Then...]

Roswaal: [But, wait. That can't be. After all, by my hand, she was...…]

Gone was the composure he had just prior, and Roswaal's voice was filled with hesitation and doubt.

At his demeanor of not stating things clearly, Garfiel blinked and then immediately bared his teeth. If it had been Garfiel himself, it was possible that some absurd idea would have popped up.

However, it was Roswaal, not Garfiel, who had come up with the thought.

Garfiel: [Bastard, this ain’t the time to be utterin’ such weak words.]

Roswaal: [————]

Beatrice: [Roswaal, clarify one thing, in fact.]

Garfiel leaned forward as if wanting to grab Roswaal by the collar. However, before his hand could stretch out in aggression, Beatrice's voice struck the silent Roswaal.

Beatrice fixed her eyes on Roswaal, and after waiting for him to meet her gaze, 

Beatrice: [The cause of your hesitation, is it related to Mother, I suppose?]

Roswaal:: [...Am I that easy to read?]

Beatrice: [Only matters related to Mother can upset you so much, in fact. And, more recently, about Ram, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [I'm confident I'd be overwhelmed if something happened to you as well.]

With that, Roswaal, who had responded with a wry smile, closed his eyes firmly and tightened his cheeks. Then, having pushed aside the hesitation and weakness from before, he opened his eyes and nodded.

Roswaal: [Beatrice's observation is correct. The mechanism by which the <u>zombies</u> are revived without the original corpse is an application of Restoration Magic. The prerequisite for this is the invocation of the soul, which is an application of the Sacrament of the Immortal King.]

Beatrice: [Both Restoration Magic and the Sacrament of the Immortal King aren’t the kind of techniques that can be used immediately upon understanding the theory, in fact. To begin with, given the feat of combining such fundamentally different types of magic, it can’t be said that there are even a handful of geniuses who can do it, I suppose. Someone who could do it would be...]

Roswaal: [——Of Teacher's lineage. However, it cannot be Teacher. Therefore…]

The "teacher" that Roswaal spoke of and the "mother" that Beatrice spoke of were the same person, and by no means could it be said that Garfiel was someone completely unrelated to them.

Although it could be confusing because there were multiple people with the same name, when he heard the name of the Witch involved, Garfiel immediately understood.

A single word from Beatrice had cut through Roswaal’s agony, and his attitude of trying to admit what he did not want to admit might have also played a role in Garfiel's understanding.

However——, 

Mizelda: [——What a boorish gaze.]

Suddenly, Mizelda murmured in a low voice.

Because it was about the intricacies of magic, Mizelda, who probably could not keep up with the conversation between Roswaal and Beatrice any more than Garfiel, had given up on understanding the cause of Roswaal's agonyand was focusing solely on attacking the undead.

The woman had stopped in her tracks, and she was looking upwards with her fierce eyes narrowed in aggression.

Garfiel also looked towards the target of the hunter's piercing gaze and choked up. Not only Garfiel, but Beatrice and Roswaal as well.

However, the reason behind the reactions from those three were slightly different.

For Garfiel, it was because he saw a familiar figure that should not have been there.

For Beatrice and Roswaal, it appeared that a more negative feeling was the reason.

——In the night sky, with long, fluttering pink hair, was a girl clad in black.

Her face was the same as the person Garfiel had admired ever since he could remember; however, with cold eyes that had never been directed at Garfiel, she was looking down at him. 

Girl: [This was not desired, but implementation was successful… apparently, this world has recognized my existence as its own life.]

The familiar face murmured in a familiar voice, gently tracing the crack that ran through her face with her hand and glaring at Garfiel and the others through her golden pupils.

In response, Roswaal swallowed his saliva with an audible gulp and opened his mouth.

Roswaal: [So, you were alive... Sphinx.]

Sphinx: [No, I am dead. ——Observation: Required.]

With an indifferent voice as if teasing, the girl with an appearance that looked exactly like Ryuzu, Garfiel's grandmother——The Witch, Sphinx, with the face of an undead, declared so.
